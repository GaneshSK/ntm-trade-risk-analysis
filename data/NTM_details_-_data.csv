(a) Manufacturers must submit a sufficient number of samples of a children's product, or samples that are identical in all material respects to the children's product, to a third party conformity assessment body for testing to support certification. The number of samples selected must be sufficient to provide a high degree of assurance that the tests conducted for certification purposes accurately demonstrate the ability of the children's product to meet all applicable children's product safety rules.

(d) If a product sample fails certification testing to the applicable children's product safety rule(s), even if other samples have passed the same certification test, the manufacturer must investigate the reasons for the failure and take the necessary steps to address the reasons for the failure. A manufacturer cannot certify the children's product until the manufacturer establishes, with a high degree of assurance that the finished product does comply with all applicable children's product safety rules.

§1107.21
(a) General requirements for all manufacturers. All manufacturers of children's products must conduct periodic testing. All periodic testing must be conducted by a third party conformity assessment body. Periodic testing must be conducted pursuant to either paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section or as provided in regulations under this title. The testing interval selected for periodic testing may be based on a fixed production interval, a set number of units produced, or another method chosen by the manufacturer based on the product produced and its manufacturing process, so long as the applicable maximum testing interval specified in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section is not exceeded. Component part testing pursuant to 16 CFR part 1109 may be used to support the periodic testing requirements of this section.
 (b) A manufacturer must conduct periodic testing to ensure compliance with the applicable children's product safety rules at least once a year, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c), and (d) of this section or as provided in regulations under this title. If a manufacturer does not conduct production testing under paragraph (c) of this section, or testing by a testing laboratory under paragraph (d) of this section, the manufacturer must conduct periodic testing as follows:
 (1) Periodic Testing Plan. Manufacturers must develop a periodic testing plan to ensure with a high degree of assurance that children's products manufactured after the issuance of a Children's Product Certificate, or since the previous periodic testing was conducted, continue to comply with all applicable children's product safety rules. The periodic testing plan must include the tests to be conducted, the intervals at which the tests will be conducted, and the number of samples tested. At each manufacturing site, the manufacturer must have a periodic testing plan specific to each children's product manufactured at that site.
 (2) Testing Interval. The testing interval selected must be short enough to ensure that, if the samples selected for testing pass the test, there is a high degree of assurance that the other untested children's products manufactured during the testing interval comply with the applicable children's product safety rules. The testing interval may vary depending upon the specific children's product safety rules that apply to the children's product, but may not exceed one year. Factors to be considered when determining the testing interval include, but are not limited to, the following:
 (i) High variability in test results, as indicated by a relatively large sample standard deviation in quantitative tests;
 (ii) Measurements that are close to the allowable numerical limit for quantitative tests;
 (iii) Known manufacturing process factors which could affect compliance with a rule. For example, if the manufacturer knows that a casting die wears down as the die nears the end of its useful life, the manufacturer may wish to test more often as the casting die wears down;
 (iv) Consumer complaints or warranty claims;
 (v) Introduction of a new set of component parts into the assembly process;
 (vi) The manufacture of a fixed number of products;
 (vii) Potential for serious injury or death resulting from a noncompliant children's product;
 (viii) The number of children's products produced annually, such that a manufacturer should consider testing a children's product more frequently if the product is produced in very large numbers or distributed widely throughout the United States;
 (ix) The children's product's similarity to other children's products with which the manufacturer is familiar and/or whether the children's product has many different component parts compared to other children's products of a similar type; or
 (x) Inability to determine the children's product's noncompliance easily through means such as visual inspection.
 (c)(1) If a manufacturer implements a production testing plan as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to ensure continued compliance of the children's product with a high degree of assurance to the applicable children's product safety rules, the manufacturer must submit samples of its children's product to a third party conformity assessment body for periodic testing to the applicable children's product safety rules at least once every two years. A manufacturer may consider the information obtained from production testing when determining the appropriate testing interval and the number of samples needed for periodic testing to ensure that there is a high degree of assurance that the other untested children's products manufactured during the testing interval comply with the applicable children's product safety rules.
 (2) Production Testing Plan. A production testing plan describes the production management techniques and tests that must be performed to provide a high degree of assurance that the products manufactured after certification continue to meet all the applicable children's product safety rules. A production testing plan may include recurring testing or the use of process management techniques, such as control charts, statistical process control programs, or failure modes and effects analyses (FMEAs) designed to control potential variations in product manufacturing that could affect the product's ability to comply with the applicable children's product safety rules. A manufacturer may use measurement techniques that are nondestructive and tailored to the needs of an individual product to ensure that a product complies with all applicable children's product safety rules. Any production test method used to conduct production testing must be effective in determining compliance. Production testing cannot consist solely of mathematical methods (such as an FMEA, with no additional components, or computer simulations). Production testing must include some testing, although it is not required that the test methods employed be the test methods used for certification. A manufacturer must document the production testing methods used to ensure continuing compliance and the basis for determining that the production testing plan provides a high degree of assurance that the product being manufactured continues to comply with all applicable children's product safety rules. A production testing plan must contain the following elements:
 (i) A description of the production testing plan, including, but not limited to, a description of the process management techniques used, the tests to be conducted, or the measurements to be taken; the intervals at which the tests or measurements will be made; the number of samples tested; and the basis for determining that the combination of process management techniques and tests provide a high degree of assurance of compliance if they are not the tests prescribed for the applicable children's product safety rule;
 (ii) At each manufacturing site, the manufacturer must have a production testing plan specific to each children's product manufactured at that site;
 (iii) The production testing interval selected for tests must ensure that, if the samples selected for production testing comply with an applicable children's product safety rule, there is a high degree of assurance that the untested products manufactured during that testing interval also will comply with the applicable children's product safety rule. Production testing intervals should be appropriate for the specific testing or alternative measurements being conducted.
 (3) If a production testing plan as described in this paragraph (c) fails to provide a high degree of assurance of compliance with all applicable children's product safety rules, the CPSC may require the manufacturer to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section or modify its production testing plan to ensure a high degree of assurance of compliance.
 (d)(1) For manufacturers conducting testing to ensure continued compliance with the applicable children's product safety rules using a testing laboratory accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2005(E), “General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories,” periodic tests by a third party conformity assessment body must be conducted at least once every three years. Any ISO/IEC 17025:2005(E)-accredited testing laboratory used for ensuring continued compliance must be accredited by an accreditation body that is accredited to ISO/IEC 17011:2004(E), “Conformity assessment—General requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies.” The test method(s) used by an ISO/IEC 17025:2005(E)-accredited testing laboratory when conducting testing to ensure continued compliance must be the same test method(s) used for certification to the applicable children's product safety rules. Manufacturers must conduct testing using the ISO/IEC 17025:2005(E)-accredited testing laboratory frequently enough to provide a high degree of assurance that the children's product continues to comply with the applicable children's product safety rules. A manufacturer may consider the information obtained from testing conducted by an ISO/IEC 17025:2005(E)-accredited testing laboratory when determining the appropriate testing interval and the number of samples for periodic testing that are needed to ensure that there is a high degree of assurance that the other untested children's products manufactured during the testing interval comply with the applicable children's product safety rules.

 (2) If the continued testing described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section fails to provide a high degree of assurance of compliance with all applicable children's product safety rules, the CPSC may require the manufacturer to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section or modify the testing frequency or number of samples required to ensure a high degree of assurance of continued compliance.
 (e) [Reserved]
 (f) A manufacturer must select representative product samples to be submitted to the third party conformity assessment body for periodic testing. The procedure used to select representative product samples for periodic testing must provide a basis for inferring compliance about the population of untested products produced during the applicable periodic testing interval. The number of samples selected for the sampling procedure must be sufficient to ensure continuing compliance with all applicable children's product safety rules. The manufacturer must document the procedure used to select the product samples for periodic testing and the basis for inferring the compliance of the product manufactured during the periodic testing interval from the results of the tested samples.

§1107.23(a)
(a) General Requirements. If a children's product undergoes a material change in product design or manufacturing process, including the sourcing of component parts, which a manufacturer exercising due care knows, or should know, could affect the product's ability to comply with the applicable children's product safety rules, the manufacturer must submit a sufficient number of samples of the materially changed children's product for testing by a third party conformity assessment body and issue a new Children's Product Certificate. The number of samples submitted must be sufficient to provide a high degree of assurance that the materially changed component part or finished product complies with the applicable children's product safety rules. A manufacturer of a children's product that undergoes a material change cannot issue a new Children's Product Certificate for the product until the product meets the requirements of the applicable children's product safety rules. The extent of such testing may depend on the nature of the material change. When a material change is limited to a component part of the finished children's product and does not affect the ability of other component parts of the children's product or the finished children's product to comply with other applicable children's product safety rules, a manufacturer may issue a new Children's Product Certificate based on the earlier third party certification tests and on test results of the changed component part conducted by a third party conformity assessment body. A manufacturer must exercise due care to ensure that any component part undergoing component part-level testing is identical in all material respects to the component part on the finished children's product. Changes that cause a children's product safety rule to no longer apply to a children's product are not considered to be material changes.",Children's products,"3407(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 360410(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 392690(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 4901(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 4902(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 4903(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 4904(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 4905(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 4908(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 4909(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 4910(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 4911(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 61(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 62(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 6506(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 8712(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940152(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940153(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940159(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940161(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940169(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940171(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940179(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940180(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940320(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940350(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940360(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940370(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940382(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940383(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940389(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940421(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940429(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 940490(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 9503(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 950490(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 9505(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 950669(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 950890(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 960321(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 960329(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 960330(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 9608(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 9609(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 9610(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 961220(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 9615(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 9619(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...), 962000(Only products which are primarily intended for a ...)",Consumer Product Safety Commission,Title 16 - Commercial Practices; Part 1107 - TESTING AND LABELING PERTAINING TO PRODUCT CERTIFICATION - PART 1107—TESTING AND LABELING PERTAINING TO PRODUCT CERTIFICATION,"76 FR 69541, Nov. 8, 2011",08-11-2011,,,1078495#16 CFR 1107,A - Protection of human life and health,The safety of children's products

Batch, for the purposes of this section, means batch as defined under § 80.2 but without the reference to transfer of custody from one facility to another facility.
 (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the refiner or importer shall test each sample collected pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to determine its sulfur content for compliance with the requirements of this subpart prior to the diesel fuel leaving the refinery or import facility, using an appropriate sampling and testing method as specified in § 80.580.
 (c)(1) Any refiner who produces motor vehicle, NRLM diesel fuel, or ECA marine fuel using computer-controlled in-line blending equipment, including the use of an on-line analyzer test method that is approved under the provisions of § 80.580, and who, subsequent to the production of the diesel fuel batch tests a composited sample of the batch under the provisions of § 80.580 for purposes of designation and reporting, is exempt from the requirement of paragraph (b) of this section to obtain the test result required under this section prior to the diesel fuel leaving the refinery, provided that the refiner obtains approval from EPA. The requirement of this paragraph (c)(1) that the in-line blending equipment must include an on-line analyzer test method that is approved under the provisions of § 80.580 is effective beginning June 1, 2006.

 (2) To obtain an exemption from paragraph (b) of this section, the refiner must submit to EPA all the information required under § 80.65(f)(4)(i)(A). A letter signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer of the company, or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the submission is true to the best of his/her belief must accompany any submission under this paragraph (c)(2).
 
 (3) Refiners who seek an exemption under paragraph (c)(2) of this section must comply with any request by EPA for additional information or any other requirements that EPA includes as part of the exemption.
 (4) Within 60 days of EPA's receipt of a submission under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, EPA will notify the refiner if the exemption is not approved or of any deficiencies in the refiner's submission, or if any additional information is required or other requirements are included in the exemption pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In the absence of such notification from EPA, the effective date of an exemption under this paragraph (c) is 60 days from EPA's receipt of the refiner's submission.

 (5) EPA reserves the right to modify the requirements of an exemption under this paragraph (c), in whole or in part, at any time, if EPA determines that the refiner's operation does not effectively or adequately control, monitor or document the sulfur content of the refinery's diesel fuel production, or if EPA determines that any other circumstances exist which merit modification of the requirements of an exemption, such as advancements in the state of the art for in-line blending measurement which allow for additional control or more accurate monitoring or documentation of sulfur content. If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or inaccurate information in any submission required for an exemption under this section, upon notification from EPA, the refiner's exemption will be void ab initio.
 
 (d) All test results under this section shall be retained for five years and must be provided to EPA upon request.
 (e) Samples collected under this section must be retained for at least 30 days and provided to EPA upon request.

§ 500.16 Measurement of container type commodities, how expressed.
 Notwithstanding other provisions of this part 500 of the regulations pertaining to the expression of net quantity of contents by measurement, commodities designed and sold at retail to be used as containers for other materials or objects, such as bags, cups, boxes, and pans, shall be labeled in accordance with the following paragraphs:
 (a) The declaration of net quantity for container commodities shall be expressed as follows:
 (1) For bag type commodities, in terms of count followed by linear dimensions of the bag (whether packaged in a perforated roll or otherwise) Net quantity of contents in terms of feet and inches shall be expressed as follows:

 (i) When the unit bag is characterized by two dimensions because of the absence of a gusset, the width and length will be expressed in inches, except that a dimension of 2 feet or more will be expressed in feet with any remainder in terms of inches or common or decimal fractions of the foot.
 
 
 (Example:
 “25 bags, 17 in. × 20 in. (43.1 × 50.8 cm)” or “200 bags, 20 in. × 2 ft. 6 in. (50.8 × 76.2 cm)”, or “50 bags, 20 in. × 21/2 ft. (50.8 × 76.2 cm)”.)
 
 

 (ii) When the unit bag is gussetted, the dimensions will be expressed as width, depth and length in terms of inches except that any dimensions of 2 feet or more will be expressed in feet with any remainder in terms of inches or the common or decimal fractions of the foot.
 
 
 (Examples:
 “25 bags, 17 in. × 4 in. × 20 in. (43 × 10 × 50 cm)”, or “200 bags, 20 in. × 12 in. × 21/2 ft. (50.8 × 30.4 × 76.2 cm)”.)
 
 

 (2) For other square, oblong, rectangular or similarly shaped containers, in terms of count followed by length, width, and depth except depth need not be listed when less than 2 inches (5.08 cm).
 
 
 (Example:
 “2 cake pans, 8 in. × 8 in. (20.3 × 20.3 cm)”, or “roasting pan, 12 in. × 8 in. × 3 in. (30.4 × 20.3 × 7.62 cm)”.)
 
 

 (3) For circular or other generally round shaped containers, except cups, and the like, in terms of count followed by diameter and depth except depth need not be listed when less than 2 inches (5.08 cm).
 
 
 (Example:
 “4 pie pans, 8 in. diameter (20.3 cm)” or “2 cake pans, 8 in. diameter × 4 in. (20.3 × 10.1 cm)”.)
 
 
 (b) When the functional use of the container is related by label reference in standard terms of measure to the capability of holding a specific quantity of substance or class of substances such references shall be a part of the net quantity statement and shall specify capacity as follows:

 (1) Liquid measure for containers which are intended to be used for liquids, semi-solids, viscous materials or mixtures of solids and liquids. The customary inch/pound statement of capacity shall be stated in terms of the largest whole U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches, quart, pint, or ounce with any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fraction of that unit.
 
 
 (Example:

United States of America,World [Valid From: 27 Sep 1973],B41,TBT regulations on production processes,"(a) General. (1) Only materials safe and suitable for the particular use for which the electrically operated toy is intended shall be employed.
 (2) Toys shall be produced in accordance with detailed material specifications, production specifications, and quality assurance programs. Quality assurance programs shall be established and maintained by each manufacturer to assure compliance with all requirements of this part.
 (3) The manufacturer or importer shall keep and maintain for 3 years after production or importation of each lot of toys (i) the material and production specifications and the description of the quality assurance program required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, (ii) the results of all inspections and tests conducted, and (iii) records of sale and distribution. These records shall be made available upon request at reasonable times to any officer or employee of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The manufacturer or importer shall permit such officer or employee to inspect and copy such records, to make such inventories of stock as he deems necessary, and to otherwise verify the accuracy of such records.
 (4) Toys shall be constructed and finished with a high degree of uniformity and as fine a grade of workmanship as is practicable in a well-equipped manufacturing establishment. Each component of a toy shall comply with the requirements set forth in this part.
 (b) [Reserved]
 (c) Protective coatings. Iron and steel parts shall be suitably protected against corrosion if the lack of a protective coating would likely produce a hazardous condition in normal use or when the toy is subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse.
 (d) Mechanical assembly—(1) General. A toy shall be designed and constructed to have the strength and rigidity necessary to withstand reasonably foreseeable damage and abuse without producing or increasing a shock, fire, or other accident hazard. An increase in hazards may be due to total or partial structural collapse of the toy resulting in a reduction of critical spacings, loosening or displacement of one or more components, or other serious defects.
 (2) Mounting. Each switch, lampholder, motor, automatic control, transformer, and similar component shall be securely mounted and shall be prevented from turning, unless the turning of such component is part of the design of the toy and produces no additional hazard such as reduced spacings below acceptable levels or stress on the connection. Friction between tight-fitting surfaces shall not be considered sufficient for preventing the turning of components. The proper use of a suitable lockwasher or a keyed and notched insert plus a suitable lockwasher for single-hole mountings shall be acceptable. Each toy shall be designed and constructed so that vibrations occurring during normal operation and after reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse will not affect it adversely. Brush caps shall be tightly threaded or otherwise designed to prevent loosening.
 
 (3) Structural integrity. Heating elements shall be supported in a substantial and reliable manner and shall be structurally prevented from making contacts inside or outside of the toy which may produce shock hazards. The current-carrying component(s) of the heating element shall be enclosed, and the enclosure shall be designed or insulated to prevent the development of a shock or fire hazard that may result from element failure. A toy operating with a gas or liquid under pressure, such as an electrically operated steam engine, shall be tested with respect to its explosion hazard and shall be provided with a pressure relief device that will discharge in the safest possible direction; that is, avoiding direct human contact and avoiding the wetting of electrical contacts.
 (e) Insulating material. (1) Material to be used for mounting uninsulated live electrical elements shall be generally accepted as suitable for the specific application, particularly with regard to electrical insulation (voltage breakdown) and good aging characteristics (no significant change in insulating characteristics over the expected lifetime of the toy).
 (2) Material used to insulate a heating element from neighboring parts shall be suitable for the purpose. If plain asbestos in a glass braid is used to so insulate the heating element, it shall be tightly packed and totally enclosed by the braid, and the overall thickness, including the braid, shall not be less than one-sixteenth inch. Hard fiber may be used for electrically insulating bushings, washers, separators, and barriers, but is not sufficient as the sole support of uninsulated live metal parts.
 (f) Enclosures—(1) General. Each toy shall have an enclosure constructed of protective material suitable for the particular application, for the express purpose of housing all electrical parts that may present a fire, shock, or other accident hazard under any conditions of normal use or reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse. Enclosures shall meet the performance requirements prescribed by § 1505.6(b).
 (2) Accessibility. An enclosure containing a wire, splice, brush cap, connection, electrical component, or uninsulated live part or parts at a potential of more than 30 volts r.m.s. (42.4 volts peak) to any other part or to ground:
 (i) Shall be sealed by welding, riveting, adhesive bonding, and/or by special screws or other fasteners not removable with a common household tool (screwdriver, pliers, or other similar household tool) used as intended; and
 (ii) Shall have no opening permitting entry of a 0.010-inch-diameter music wire that could contact a live part. Cross-notch-head screws, spring clips, bent tabs, and similar fasteners shall not be considered suitable sealing devices for enclosures since they are easy to remove with common household tools. Bent tabs shall be acceptable if, due to metal thickness or other factors, they successfully resist forceful attempts to dislodge them with ordinary tools.
 (3) Nonapplication. The requirements of this paragraph are not applicable to an insulating husk enclosure or equivalent that covers the electrodes of a replaceable incandescent lamp and its lampholder contacts. The primary function of an enclosure containing a lamp shall be to protect it from breakage during normal use or reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse.
 (g) Spacings. The distance, through air or across the surface of an insulator, between uninsulated live metal parts and a metallic enclosure and between uninsulated live metal parts and all other metal parts shall be suitable for the specific application as determined by the dielectric strength requirements prescribed by § 1505.6(e)(2). Electrical insulating linings on barriers shall be held securely in place.
 (h) Special safety features—(1) Moving parts. If the normal use of a toy involves accident hazards, suitable protection shall be provided for the reduction of such hazards to an acceptable minimum. For example, rotors, pulleys, belting, gearing, and other moving parts shall be enclosed or guarded to prevent accidental contact during normal use or when subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse. Such enclosure or guard shall not contain openings that permit entrance of a 1/4-inch-diameter rod and present a hazardous condition.
 
 (2) Switch marking. Any toy having one or more moving parts which perform an inherent function of the toy and which may cause personal injury shall have a switch that can deenergize the toy by a simple movement to a plainly marked “OFF” position. Momentary contact switches which are normally in the “OFF” position need not be so marked.
 (3) Electrically operated sewing machines. Electrically operated toy sewing machines shall be designed and constructed to eliminate the possibility of a child's finger(s) being pierced by a needle. For the purpose of this paragraph, a clearance of not more than five thirty-seconds of an inch below the point of the needle when in its uppermost position or below the presser foot, if provided, shall be considered satisfactory.
 (4) Pressure relief valves. A pressurized enclosure shall have an automatic pressure relief device and shall be capable of withstanding hydrostatic pressure equal to at least five times the relief pressure.
 (5) Containers for heated materials. Containers intended for holding molten compounds and hot liquids shall be designed and constructed to minimize accidental spillage. A pot or pan having a lip and one or more properly located pouring spouts and an adequately thermally insulated handle may provide satisfactory protection. Containers intended solely for baking need not be designed and constructed to minimize accidental spillage. Containers shall be of such material and construction t+at they will not deform or melt when subjected to the maximum operating temperature occurring during normal use or after reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse.
 (6) Water. Electrically operated toys (such as toy irons) shall not be designed or manufactured to be used with water except for toy steam engines or other devices in which the electrical components are separate from the water reservoir and are completely contained in a sealed chamber. Toys requiring occasional or repeated cleaning with a wet cloth shall be constructed to prevent seepage of water into any electrically active area that may produce a hazardous condition.",Electrically

 § 14.81
 Marking requirement.
 Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, no person may import, export, or transport in interstate commerce any container or package containing any fish or wildlife (including shellfish and fishery products) unless he/she marks each container or package conspicuously on the outside with both the name and address of the shipper and consignee. An accurate and legible list of its contents by species scientific name and the number of each species and whether or not the listed species are venomous must accompany the entire shipment.

 § 14.82
 Alternatives and exceptions to the marking requirement.
 (a) The requirements of § 14.81 may be met by complying with one of the following alternatives to the marking requirement:
 (1)(i) Conspicuously marking the outside of each container or package containing fish or wildlife with the word “fish” or “wildlife” as appropriate for its contents, or with the common name of its contents by species, and
 (ii) Including an invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or similar document to accompany the shipment which accurately states the name and address of the shipper and consignee, states the total number of packages or containers in the shipment, and for each species in the shipment specifies:
 (A) The common name that identifies the species (examples include: Chinook (or king) salmon; bluefin tuna; and whitetail deer) and whether or not the listed species is venomous; and
 (B) The number of that species (or other appropriate measure of quantity such as gross or net weight).
 The invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or equivalent document must be securely attached to the outside of one container or package in the shipment or otherwise physically accompany the shipment in a manner which makes it readily accessible for inspection; or
 (2) Affixing the shipper's wildlife import/export license number preceded by the three letters “FWS” on the outside of each container or package containing fish or wildlife, if the shipper has valid wildlife import/export license issued under authority of 50 CFR part 14. For each shipment marked in accordance with this paragraph, the records maintained under § 14.93(c) must include a copy of the invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or other similar document that accurately states the information required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

 (3) In the case of subcontainers or packages within a larger packing container, only the outermost container must be marked in accordance with this section. Except, that for live fish or wildlife that are packed in subcontainers within a larger packing container, if the subcontainers are numbered or labeled, the packing list, invoice, bill or lading, or other similar document, must reflect that number or label. However, each subcontainer containing a venomous species must be clearly marked as venomous.
 (4) A conveyance (truck, plane, boat, etc.) is not considered a container for purposes of requiring specific marking of the conveyance itself, provided that:
 (i) The fish or wildlife within the conveyance is carried loosely or is readily identifiable, and is accompanied by the document required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, or
 (ii) The fish or wildlife is otherwise packaged and marked in accordance with this subpart.
 (b) The requirements of § 14.81 do not apply to containers or packages containing—
 (1) Fox, nutria, rabbit, mink, chinchilla, marten, fisher, muskrat, and karakul that have been bred and born in captivity, or their products, if a signed statement certifying that the animals were bred and born in captivity accompanies the shipping documents;

 (2) Fish or shellfish contained in retail consumer packages labeled pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.; or
 (3) Fish or shellfish that are landed by, and offloaded from, a fishing vessel (whether or not the catch has been carried by the fishing vessel interstate), as long as the fish or shellfish remain at the place where first offloaded.

A “children's toy” is defined as a consumer product designed or intended by the manufacturer for a child 12 years of age or younger for use by the child when the child plays. A toy can be placed in a child's mouth if any part of the toy can actually be brought to the mouth and kept in the mouth by a child so that it can be sucked and chewed.

United States of America,World [Valid From: 25 Jun 2013],B83,Certification requirement,"(b) Objectives. (1) TSCA is intended to be comprehensive, and assure protection of health and the environment from unreasonable risks associated with chemicals whether the chemicals are imported or produced domestically. This intent is manifested by the inclusion of importation in the Act's definition of the term “manufacture”: “[M]anufacture means to import * * *, produce, or manufacture” (15 U.S.C. 2602(7)). Thus, importers are responsible for insuring that chemical importation complies with TSCA just as domestic manufacturers are responsible for insuring that chemical manufacture complies with TSCA.
 (2)(i) The section 13 rule requires importers to sign the following statement for each import of chemical substances subject to TSCA: “I certify that all chemical substances in this shipment comply with all applicable rules or orders under TSCA and that I am not offering a chemical substance for entry in violation of TSCA or any applicable rule or order under TSCA.” The certification will document that, in accordance with TSCA, the importer has taken the necessary steps to insure compliance.
 (ii) The section 13 rule requires importers of chemicals not subject to TSCA (e.g., pesticides) to certify that compliance with TSCA is not required. Importers must certify this by signing the statement: “I certify that all chemicals in this shipment are not subject to TSCA.” This is appropriate when a chemical import is not clearly identified as a pesticide or other chemical not subject to TSCA.
 (3) The United States is involved in a major effort toward international harmonization in the control of chemicals. At such time as international agreement is reached on this issue, EPA would be prepared to modify its policy if necessary. EPA believes that its international harmonization efforts in the control of chemicals will protect health and the environment while fulfilling its obligations under the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.
 (c) The section 13 rule—(1) General certification. (i) The rule promulgated under section 13 of TSCA by Customs, in consultation with EPA, implements the requirement of section 13 that chemical substances, mixtures, or articles not in compliance with TSCA, or whose importation is not in compliance with TSCA, shall be denied entry into the customs territory of the United States. The rule requires that importers certify by a statement, on the entry document or invoice, that any shipment of a chemical substance subject to TSCA, imported in bulk or as part of a mixture, complies with TSCA, and that it is not offered for entry in violation of TSCA or any rule or order under TSCA, or that the chemicals imported are not subject to TSCA.
 (ii) The certification applies to TSCA sections 5, 6, and 7.
 (iii) EPA expects that this certification will be based upon actual knowledge of the importer in most cases. However, EPA realizes that sometimes importers may not have actual knowledge of the chemical composition of imported mixtures. In these cases, the importer should attempt to discover the chemical constituents of the shipment by contacting another party to the transaction (e.g., his principal or the foreign manufacturer). This person may be able to identify the components of the mixture, or at least state that the substances comply with TSCA. The greater the effort an importer makes to learn the identities of the imported substances and their compliance with TSCA, the smaller his chance of committing a violation by importing a noncomplying shipment. If a shipment is ultimately determined to have violated TSCA, the good faith efforts of the importer to verify compliance, as evidenced by documents contained in his files, may obviate or mitigate the assessment of a civil penalty under section 16 of TSCA.
 (2) EPA enforcement. (i) EPA and Customs will monitor chemical imports to determine if shipments and their import comply with the certification requirements and the substantive mandates of TSCA. Customs will refuse entry to any shipment until such time as the certification is properly submitted. Customs will also detain a shipment if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such shipment or its import violates TSCA or regulations or orders thereunder. A violative shipment must either be brought into compliance, exported, destroyed, or voluntarily abandoned within the time periods prescribed in 19 CFR 12.124 of the section 13 rule.

 (ii) When EPA determines that a shipment should be detained, EPA will identify the reasons for the detention and the necessary actions for an importer to bring the shipment into compliance with TSCA. If EPA has given this information to Customs before the district director issues the detention notice, the information will become part of the detention notice. The importer should contact one of the following EPA regional offices for guidance as to the proper procedures to correct any deficiencies in the shipment.

 (iii) If Customs detains or refuses entry of a shipment (other than for failure to make the general certification) and the importer takes measures necessary to bring the shipment into conformity with the requirements of TSCA, EPA officials will reassess the shipment to determine its current compliance status. When a shipment is no longer in violation, EPA will notify the district director and the importer. The district director will then release the shipment. This notice will also serve as a determination to permit entry under 19 CFR 12.123(c) if a shipment is brought into compliance before the 19 CFR 12.123(c) decisionmaking process has been completed. If compliance is achieved after a 19 CFR 12.123(c) determination (adverse to the importer) has been made, the EPA notice to the district director will serve as a reversal of the decision to refuse entry.

Under the authority of sections 2(f)(1)(D) and 24 of the act and pursuant to the provisions of section 3(e) of the act, the Commission has determined that the following types of toys or other articles intended for use by children present a mechanical hazard within the meaning of section 2(s) of the act because in normal use, or when subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse, the design or manufacture presents an unreasonable risk of personal injury or illness:
 (1) Any toy rattle containing, either internally or externally, rigid wires, sharp protrusions, or loose small objects that have the potential for causing lacerations, puncture wound injury, aspiration, ingestion, or other injury. (But see § 1500.86(a)(1)).
 (2) Any toy having noisemaking components or attachments capable of being dislodged by the operating features of the toy or capable of being deliberately removed by a child, which toy has the potential for causing laceration, puncture wound injury, aspiration, ingestion, or other injury.
 (3) Any doll, stuffed animal, or other similar toy having internal or external components that have the potential for causing laceration, puncture wound injury, or other similar injury. (But see § 1500.86(a)(2)); (See also §§ 1500.48 and 1500.49).

 (5) [Reserved]
 (6) Any article known as a “baby-bouncer” or “walker-jumper” and any other similar article (referred to in this paragraph as “article(s)”), except an infant walker subject to part 1216, which is intended to support very young children while sitting, bouncing, jumping, and/or reclining, and which because of its design has any exposed parts capable of causing amputation, crushing, lacerations, fractures, hematomas, bruises, or other injuries to fingers, toes, or other parts of the anatomy of young children. Included among, but not limited to, the design features of such articles which classify the articles as banned hazardous substances are:
 (i) The areas about the point on each side of the article where the frame components are joined together to form an “X” shape capable of producing a scissoring, shearing, or pinching effect.
 (ii) Other areas where two or more parts are joined in such a manner as to permit a rotational movement capable of exerting a scissoring, shearing, or pinching effect.
 (iii) Exposed coil springs which may expand sufficiently to allow an infant's finger, toe, or any other part of the anatomy to be inserted, in whole or in part, and injured by being caught between the coils of the spring or between the spring and another part of the article.
 (iv) Holes in plates or tubes which provide the possibility of insertion, in whole or in part, of a finger, toe, or any part of the anatomy that could then be injured by the movement of another part of the article.
 (v) Design and construction that permits accidental collapse while in use. (But see § 1500.86(a)(4)).
 (7) Toys usually known as clacker balls and consisting of two balls of plastic or another material connected by a length of line or cord or similar connector (referred to as “cord” in § 1500.86(a)(5)), intended to be operated in a rhythmic manner by an upward and downward motion of the hand so that the two balls will meet forcefully at the top and bottom of two semicircles thus causing a “clacking” sound, which toys present a mechanical hazard because their design or manufacture presents an unreasonable risk of personal injury from fracture, fragmentations, or disassembly of the toy and from propulsion of the toy or its part(s). (But see § 1500.86(a)(5).) This does not include products that are constructed so that the connecting members consist of plastic rods integrally molded to the balls and are mounted on a pivot so that movement of the balls is essentially limited to a single plane.

 (8) Any pacifier that does not meet the requirements of 16 CFR part 1511 and that is introduced into interstate commerce after February 26, 1978.
 (9) Any toy or other article intended for use by children under 3 years of age which presents a choking, aspiration, or ingestion hazard because of small parts as determined by part 1501 of this chapter and which is introduced into interstate commerce after January 1, 1980. For purposes of this regulation, introduction into interstate commerce is defined as follows: A toy or children's article manufactured outside the United States is introduced into interstate commerce when it is first brought within a U.S. port of entry. A toy or children's article manufactured in the United States is introduced into interstate commerce (1) at the time of its first interstate sale, or (2) at the time of its first intrastate sale if one or more of its components and/or raw materials were received interstate, whichever occurs earlier. Part 1501 defines the term “toy or other article intended for use by children under 3,” as used in this regulation, and exempts certain products from banning under this regulation.

 (12) Any bicycle as defined in § 1512.2(a) of this chapter (except a bicycle that is a “track bicycle” or a “one-of-a-kind bicycle” as defined in § 1512.2 (d) and (e) of this chapter) that is introduced into interstate commerce on or after May 11, 1976, and that does not comply with the requirements of part 1512 of this chapter, except for §§ 1512.5(c)(3), 1512.9(a), 1512.18(e) and 1512.18(f) which become effective November 13, 1976.
 (15) Any rattle (as defined in § 1510.2 of this chapter) that is introduced into interstate commerce on or after August 21, 1978, and that does not comply with the requirements of part 1510 of this chapter. For purposes of the regulation, introduction into interstate commerce is defined as follows: A rattle manufactured outside the United States is introduced into interstate commerce when it is first brought within a U.S. port of entry. A rattle manufactured in the United States is introduced into interstate commerce (a) at the time of its first interstate sale, or (b) at the time of its first intrastate sale if one or more of its components and/or raw materials were received interstate.
 (16) (i) Any article known as an “infant cushion” or “infant pillow,” and any other similar article, which has all of the following characteristics (But see § 1500.86(a)(9)):
 (A) Has a flexible fabric covering. The term fabric includes those materials covered by the definition of “fabric” in section 2(f) of the Flammable Fabrics Act, 15 U.S.C. 1191(f).
 (B) Is loosely filled with a granular material, including but not limited to, polystyrene beads or pellets.
 (C) Is easily flattened.
 (D) Is capable of conforming to the body or face of an infant.
 (E) Is intended or promoted for use by children under one year of age.
 (ii) Findings—(A) General. In order to issue a rule under section 2(q)(1) of the Federal Hazardous Substance Act (FHSA), 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1), classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the FHSA requires the Commission to make certain findings and to include these findings in the regulation. These findings are discussed in paragraphs (a)(16)(ii) (B) through (D) of this section.
 (B) Voluntary standard. No findings concerning compliance with or adequacy of a voluntary standard are necessary since no voluntary standard addressing infant cushions has been adopted or implemented.
 (C) Relationship of benefits to costs. The Commission estimates that the removal of infant cushions from the market will result in total annual benefits of approximately five million dollars. The potential costs to businesses are expected to be offset by production of other products, and the potential costs to consumers are likely to be offset by the availability of substitutes for a comparable price.
 (D) Least burdensome requirement. The Commission considered labeling and a design or performance standard as alternatives to the ban. The Commission does not believe that any form of labeling would have a significant effect in preventing the hazard associated with infant cushions. The Commission also concluded that no feasible standard exists that would address the hazard. Thus, the Commission determined that a ban of infant cushions is the least burdensome alternative that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of injury.
 (17) Any ball intended for children under three years of age that, under the influence of its own weight, passes, in any orientation, entirely through a circular hole with a diameter of 1.75 inches (44.4 mm.) in a rigid template 1/4 inches (6 mm.) thick. In testing to evaluate compliance with this paragraph, the diameter of opening in the Commission's test template shall be no greater than 1.75 inches (44.4 mm.).
 (i) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “ball” includes any spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal object that is designed or intended to be thrown, hit, kicked, rolled, dropped, or bounced. The term “ball” includes any spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal object that is attached to a toy or article by means of a string, elastic cord, or similar tether. The term “ball” also includes any multi-sided object formed by connecting planes into a generally spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal shape that is designated or intended to be used as a ball, and any novelty item of a generally spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal shape that is designated or intended to be used as a ball.
 (ii) The term “ball” does not include dice, or balls permanently enclosed inside pinball machines, mazes, or similar outer containers. A ball is permanently enclosed if, when tested in accordance with 16 CFR 1500.52, the ball is not removed from the outer container.
 (iii) In determining whether such a ball is intended for use by children under three years of age, the criteria specified in 16 CFR 1501.2(b) and the enforcement procedure established by 16 CFR 1501.5 shall apply.
 (18)(i) Any bunk bed (as defined in § 1513.2(c) of this chapter) that does not comply with the requirements of part 1513 of this chapter.
 (ii) Findings. In order to issue a rule under Section 3(e) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), 15 U.S.C. 1262(e), classifying a toy or other article intended for use by children as a hazardous substance on the basis that it presents a mechanical hazard (as defined in Section 2(s) of the FHSA), the FHSA requires the Commission to make the following findings and to include these findings in the regulation: Bunk beds present a mechanical hazard; Where a voluntary standard has been adopted and implemented by the affected industry, that compliance with such voluntary standard is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury, or it is unlikely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standard; The benefits expected from the rule bear a reasonable relationship to its costs; and The rule imposes the least burdensome requirement that prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the rule is being promulgated. These findings are made in the appendix to Part 1513.
 (19)(i) Dive sticks, and other similar articles, that are used in swimming pools or other water environments for such activities as underwater retrieval games or swimming instruction, and which, when placed in the water, submerge and rest at the bottom of the pool. This includes products that are pre-weighted to sink to the bottom and products that are designed to allow the user to adjust the weight. Dive sticks and similar articles that come to rest underwater at an angle greater than 45 degrees from vertical when measured under the test at § 1500.86(a)(7) and dive sticks and similar articles that maintain a compressive force of less than 5-lbf under the test at § 1500.86(a)(8) are exempt from this banning rule. Articles that have a continuous circular shape, such as dive rings and dive disks are also exempt.
 (ii)(A) Findings. In order for the Commission to issue a rule under section 2(q)(1) of the FHSA classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the Commission must make certain findings and include these findings in the regulation. 15 U.S.C. 1262(i)(2). These findings are discussed in paragraphs (a)(18)(ii)(B) through (D) of this section.
 (B) Voluntary standard. No findings concerning compliance with and adequacy of a voluntary standard are necessary because no relevant voluntary standard addressing the risk of injury posed by dive sticks has been adopted and implemented.
 (C) Relationship of benefits to costs. The Commission estimates the potential benefits of removing hazardous dive sticks from the market to be 2 to 4 cents per dive stick. With the availability of substitutes and the expected low cost of modifying dive sticks to conform to the rule, the Commission anticipates that necessary changes will be minimal. The Commission estimates that the costs of the rule will be no more than 2 to 4 cents per dive stick. Thus, the Commission finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the expected benefits of the rule and its costs.
 (D) Least burdensome requirement. The Commission considered pursuing voluntary recalls, following a voluntary standard, requiring labeling or changing the scope of the rule. A banning rule would be more effective than case-by-case recalls because the impalement hazard affects all dive sticks, not a specific brand or model. Awaiting recalls would allow these hazardous items on the market until the Commission obtained recalls. No applicable voluntary standard exists, and compliance may be low if one did. Although labeling could help reduce the risk of injuries from dive sticks, it would be less effective than a banning rule. It may be difficult for a label to convey the necessary information at the time of use. Modifying the scope so that the rule would only apply to pre-weighted dive sticks would continue to permit hazardous items because the unweighted dive sticks can easily be weighted to stand vertically at the bottom of the water. Thus, the Commission finds that a ban of dive sticks with the hazardous characteristics it has identified is the least burdensome alternative that would adequately reduce the risk of injury.
 (b) Electrically operated toys and other electrical operated children's articles presenting electrical, thermal, and/or certain mechanical hazards. Under the authority of section 2(f)(1)(D) of the act and pursuant to provisions of section 3(e) of the act, the Commission has determined that the following types of electrically operated toys or other electrically operated articles intended for use by children present electrical, thermal, and/or certain mechanical hazards within the meaning of section 2 (r), (s), and/or (t) of the act because in normal use or when subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse, the design or manufacture may cause personal injury or illness by electric shock and/or presents an unreasonable risk of personal injury or illness because of heat as from heated parts, substances, or surfaces, or because of certain mechanical hazards.

 (1) Any electrically operated toy or other electrically operated article intended for use by children (as defined in § 1505.1(a)(1)) that is introduced into interstate commerce and which does not comply with the requirements of part 1505 of this chapter.
 
 
 Note:
 Paragraph (b)(1) was originally promulgated as 21 CFR 191.9a(b)(1) with an effective date of September 3, 1973 (38 FR 6138).
 
 
 (2) [Reserved]
 (c) Toys and other articles (not electrically operated) presenting electric hazards. Under the authority of section 2(f)(1)(D) of the act and pursuant to provisions of section 3(e) of the act, the Commission has determined that the following types of toys or other articles intended for use by children (not electrically operated) present an electrical hazard within the meaning of section 2(r) of the act.
 (1) Any kite 10 inches or greater in any dimension constructed of aluminized polyester film or any kite having a tail or other component consisting of a piece of aluminized polyester film 10 inches or greater in any dimension presents an electrical hazard and is a banned hazardous substance because its design (specifically its size and electrical conductivity) presents a risk of personal injury from electric shock due to its ability to conduct electricity and to become entangled in or otherwise contact high voltage electric power lines.

United States of America,World [Valid From: 16 Sep 1997],A851,Origin of materials and parts,"(a) All lots of agricultural seed, vegetable seed, and screenings imported into the United States must be accompanied by a declaration from the importer of the seed or screenings. The declaration must state the kind, variety, and origin of each lot of seed or screenings and the use for which the seed or screenings are being imported.
 (b) Each container of agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported into the United States for seeding (planting) purposes must be labeled to indicate the identification code or designation for the lot of seed; the name of each kind or kind and variety of agricultural seed or the name of each kind and variety of vegetable seed present in the lot in excess of 5 percent of the whole; and the designation “hybrid” when the lot contains hybrid seed. Kind and variety names used on the label shall conform to the kind and variety names used in the definitions of “agricultural seed” and “vegetable seed” in § 361.1. If any seed in the lot has been treated, each container must be further labeled, in type no smaller than 8 point, as follows:
 (1) The label must indicate that the seed has been treated and provide the name of the substance or process used to treat the seed. Substance names used on the label shall be the commonly accepted coined, chemical (generic), or abbreviated chemical name.
 (i) Commonly accepted coined names are commonly recognized as names of particular substances, e.g., thiram, captan, lindane, and dichlone.
 (ii) Examples of commonly accepted chemical (generic) names are blue-stone, calcium carbonate, cuprous oxide, zinc hydroxide, hexachlorobenzene, and ethyl mercury acetate. The terms “mercury” or “mercurial” may be used in labeling all types of mercurials.
 (iii) Examples of commonly accepted abbreviated chemical names are BHC (1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDT (dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane).

 (2) If the seed has been treated with a mercurial or similarly toxic substance harmful to humans and vertebrate animals, the label must include a representation of a skull and crossbones and a statement indicating that the seed has been treated with poison. The skull and crossbones must be at least twice the size of the type used for the information provided on the label, and the poison warning statement must be written in red letters on a background of distinctly contrasting color. Mercurials and similarly toxic substances include the following:
 
 
 Aldrin, technical
 Demeton
 Dieldrin

 (3) If the seed has been treated with a substance other than one classified as a mercurial or similarly toxic substance under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and the amount remaining with the seed is harmful to humans or other vertebrate animals, the label must indicate that the seed is not to be used for food, feed, or oil purposes. Any amount of any substance used to treat the seed that remains with the seed will be considered harmful when the seed is in containers of more than 4 ounces, except that the following substances will not be deemed harmful when present at a rate less than the number of parts per million (p/m) indicated:
 
 
 Allethrin—2 p/m
 Malathion—8 p/m
 Methoxyclor—2 p/m
 Piperonyl butoxide—20 p/m (8 p/m on oat and sorghum)
 Pyrethrins—3 p/m (1 p/m on oat and sorghum)
 
 
 (c) In the case of seed in bulk, the information required under paragraph (b) of this section shall appear in the invoice or other records accompanying and pertaining to such seed. If the seed is in containers and in quantities of 20,000 pounds or more, regardless of the number of lots included, the information required on each container under paragraph (b) of this section need not be shown on each container if each container has stenciled upon it or bears a label containing a lot designation and the invoice or other records accompanying and pertaining to such seed bear the various statements required for the respective seeds.

The level of control for exports and imports of waste is indicated by assignment of the waste to either a list of wastes subject to the Green control procedures or a list of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures and by the national procedures of the United States, as defined in § 262.80(a). The OECD Green and Amber lists are incorporated by reference in § 262.89(d).
 (1) Listed wastes subject to the Green control procedures. (i) Green wastes that are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a) are subject to existing controls normally applied to commercial transactions.
 (ii) Green wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures set forth in this subpart.
 (2) Listed wastes subject to the Amber control procedures.(i) Amber wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures set forth in this subpart.
 (ii) Amber wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a), are subject to the Amber control procedures in the United States, even if they are imported to or exported from a designated OECD Member country listed in § 262.58(a)(1) that does not consider the waste to be hazardous. In such an event, the responsibilities of the Amber control procedures shift as provided:
 (A) For U.S. exports, the United States shall issue an acknowledgement of receipt and assume other responsibilities of the competent authority of the country of import.
 (B) For U.S. imports, the U.S. recovery facility/importer and the United States shall assume the obligations associated with the Amber control procedures that normally apply to the exporter and country of export, respectively.

 (iii) Amber wastes that are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a), but are considered hazardous by an OECD Member country are subject to the Amber control procedures in the OECD Member country that considers the waste hazardous. All responsibilities of the U.S. importer/exporter shift to the importer/exporter of the OECD Member country that considers the waste hazardous unless the parties make other arrangements through contracts.
 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(2):

 Some wastes subject to the Amber control procedures are not listed or otherwise identified as hazardous under RCRA, and therefore are not subject to the Amber control procedures of this subpart. Regardless of the status of the waste under RCRA, however, other Federal environmental statutes (e.g., the Toxic Substances Control Act) restrict certain waste imports or exports. Such restrictions continue to apply with regard to this subpart.
 
 
 (3) Procedures for mixtures of wastes. (i) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more other Green wastes such that the resulting mixture is not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a) shall be subject to the Green control procedures, provided the composition of this mixture does not impair its environmentally sound recovery.
 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(3)(i):
 The regulated community should note that some OECD Member countries may require, by domestic law, that mixtures of different Green wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures.
 
 

 (ii) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more Amber wastes, in any amount, de minimis or otherwise, or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes, such that the resulting waste mixture is considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures, provided the composition of this mixture does not impair its environmentally sound recovery.
 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(3)(ii):

 The regulated community should note that some OECD Member countries may require, by domestic law, that a mixture of a Green waste and more than a de minimis amount of an Amber waste or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures.
 
 
 (4) Wastes not yet assigned to an OECD waste list are eligible for transboundary movements, as follows:
 (i) If such wastes are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a), such wastes are subject to the Amber control procedures.
 (ii) If such wastes are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a), such wastes are subject to the Green control procedures.
 (b) General conditions applicable to transboundary movements of hazardous waste: (1) The waste must be destined for recovery operations at a facility that, under applicable domestic law, is operating or is authorized to operate in the importing country;

 (2) The transboundary movement must be in compliance with applicable international transport agreements; and
 
 
 Note to paragraph (b)(2):
 These international agreements include, but are not limited to, the Chicago Convention (1944), ADR (1957), ADNR (1970), MARPOL Convention (1973/1978), SOLAS Convention (1974), IMDG Code (1985), COTIF (1985), and RID (1985).
 
 
 (3) Any transit of waste through a non-OECD Member country must be conducted in compliance with all applicable international and national laws and regulations.

(e) Duty to return wastes subject to the Amber control procedures from a country of transit. When a transboundary movement of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures does not comply with the requirements of the notification and movement documents or otherwise constitutes illegal shipment, and if alternative arrangements cannot be made to recover these wastes in an environmentally sound manner, the waste must be returned to the country of export. The following provisions apply as appropriate:
 (1) Return from the United States (as country of transit) to the country of export: The U.S. transporter must inform EPA at the specified address in § 262.83(b)(1)(i) of the need to return the shipment. EPA will then inform the competent authority of the country of export, citing the reason(s) for returning the waste. The U.S. transporter must complete the return within ninety (90) days from the time EPA informs the country of export of the need to return the waste, unless informed in writing by EPA of another timeframe agreed to by the concerned Member countries.
 (2) Return from the country of transit to the United States (as country of export): The U.S. exporter must provide for the return of the hazardous waste shipment within ninety (90) days from the time the competent authority of the country of transit informs EPA of the need to return the waste or such other period of time as the concerned Member countries agree. The U.S. exporter must submit an exception report to EPA in accordance with § 262.87(b).
 (f) Requirements for wastes destined for and received by R12 and R13 facilities. The transboundary movement of wastes destined for R12 and R13 operations must comply with all Amber control procedures for notification and consent as set forth in § 262.83 and for the movement document as set forth in § 262.84. Additional responsibilities of R12/R13 facilities include:
 (1) Indicating in the notification document the foreseen recovery facility or facilities where the subsequent R1-R11 recovery operation takes place or may take place.
 (2) Within three (3) days of the receipt of the wastes by the R12/R13 recovery facility or facilities, the facility(ies) shall return a signed copy of the movement document to the exporter and to the competent authorities of the countries of export and import. The facility(ies) shall retain the original of the movement document for three (3) years.
 (3) As soon as possible, but no later than thirty (30) days after the completion of the R12/R13 recovery operation and no later than one (1) calendar year following the receipt of the waste, the R12 or R13 facility(ies) shall send a certificate of recovery to the foreign exporter and to the competent authority of the country of export and to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Federal Activities, International Compliance Assurance Division (2254A), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. Washington, DC 20460, by mail, e-mail without digital signature followed by mail, or fax followed by mail.
 (4) When an R12/R13 recovery facility delivers wastes for recovery to an R1-R11 recovery facility located in the country of import, it shall obtain as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) calendar year following delivery of the waste, a certification from the R1-R11 facility that recovery of the wastes at that facility has been completed. The R12/R13 facility must promptly transmit the applicable certification to the competent authorities of the countries of import and export, identifying the transboundary movements to which the certification pertain.
 (5) When an R12/R13 recovery facility delivers wastes for recovery to an R1-R11 recovery facility located:
 (i) In the initial country of export, Amber control procedures apply, including a new notification;
 (ii) In a third country other than the initial country of export, Amber control procedures apply, with the additional provision that the competent authority of the initial country of export shall also be notified of the transboundary movement.","Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materials Utilized for Precious Metal Recovery and universal waste management (batteries, pesticides, mercury-containing equipment and lamps)","1522(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 230310(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 230320(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2304(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2305(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2306(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2307(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 240130(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2620(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2621(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 271091(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 271099(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 271390(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 300692(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 3825(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 4004(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 4017(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 411520(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 440139(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 440140(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 450190(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 4707(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7001(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7112(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720410(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720421(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720429(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720430(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720441(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720449(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7404(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7503(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7602(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7802(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7902(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 8002(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810197(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810297(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810330(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810420(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810530(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 8106(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810730(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810830(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810930(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811020(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811213(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811222(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811252(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811292(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 8113(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 854810(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...)",Environmental Protection Agency,Title 40 - Protection of Environment; Part 262 - STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE - Subpart H—Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste for Recovery Within the OECD,"75 FR 1253, Jan. 8, 2010",08-01-2010,,,1078576#40 CFR 262,_ - No objective specified,Environmental preservation

United States of America,World [Valid From: 27 Sep 1973],B82,Testing requirement,"§ 1505.6 Performance
 (a) General. Electrically operated toys and components thereof shall be tested by the appropriate methods described in this section and shall pass the tests in such a manner as to provide the necessary assurance that normal use and reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse will not produce a hazard or a potentially hazardous condition. The toy shall be capable of passing all applicable tests with any door, cover, handle, operable part, or accessory placed in any normal position. A toy shall not present a fire, casualty, or shock hazard when operated continuously for 6 hours under conditions of normal use and reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse, including the most hazardous position in which the toy can be left.
 (b) Enclosures. For the purposes of this section, the term enclosure means any surface or surrounding structure which prevents access to a real or potential hazard. An enclosure shall withstand impact, compression, and pressure tests (see paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section) without developing any openings above those specified, reduction of electrical spacings below those specified, or other fire, casualty, or shock hazards, including the loosening or displacement of components but excluding breakage of a lamp. After completion of each test, the toy shall comply with the requirements of the dielectric strength test described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and, upon visual examination, shall not evidence the development of any hazards. Rupture of a fuse shall be considered a test failure.
 (1) Impact test. A toy weighing 10 pounds or less shall be dropped four times from a height of 3 feet onto a 21/2 inch thick concrete slab covered with 0.125 inch nominal thickness vinyl title. The impact area shall be at least 3 square feet. The test shall be conducted while the toy is energized and operating and with all dead metal of the toy that may be energized connected together electrically and grounded through a 3-ampere plug fuse. The toy shall be dropped in random orientation. After each drop the test sample shall be allowed to come to rest and examined and evaluated before continuing.
 (2) Compression test. Any area on the surface of the enclosure that is accessible to a child and inaccessible to flat-surface contact during the impact test shall be subjected to a direct force of 20 pounds for 1 minute. The force shall be applied over a period of 5 seconds through the axis of a 1/2-inch-diameter metal rod having a flat end with the edge rounded to a radius of one thirty-seconds of an inch to eliminate sharp edges. The axis of the rod shall be perpendicular to the surface being tested. During the test the toy shall rest on a flat, hard surface in any test-convenient position.
 (3) Pressure test. If any portion of the top of a toy has a flat surface measuring 24 square inches or more and a minor dimension of at least 3 inches, that surface shall be subjected to a direct vertical pressure increasing to 50 pounds over a period of 5 seconds and maintained for 1 minute. The force shall be applied through a steel ball 2 inches in diameter. During the test the toy shall be in an upright position on a flat, horizontal solid surface.
 (c) Handles and knobs—(1) General. For the purposes of tests in this paragraph, the parts of a lifting handle on a toy that are within seven-sixteenths of an inch of the surface to which the handle is attached, or the parts of a lifting knob that are within one-fourth inch of the surface to which the knob is attached, are considered to be for support purposes, and the remainder of the handle or knob is considered to be generally functional in nature. A handle or knob shall withstand crushing and lifting tests (see paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section) without fracture of the handle or knob, development of an opening that may pinch the hand, or breakage of the means used to fasten the handle or knob in place.
 (2) Crushing test. The functional portion of a handle or knob shall be subjected to a crushign force increasing to 20 pounds over a period of 5 seconds and maintained for 1 minute. The force shall be applied through two flat and parallel hardwood blocks, each at least 21/2 inches thick and each having dimensions slightly exceeding those of the handle or knob being tested. The crushing force between the blocks shall be exerted in any direction perpendicular to the major axis of the handle or knob.
 (3) Lifting test. The support portion of a handle or knob shall be subjected to a force equal to four times the weight of the object it is intended to support. The direction of the lifting force shall be as intended by the design of the toy and shall be applied through a 1/2-inch-wide strap through or around a handle or by fingers or the equivalent on a knob. The force shall be applied over a period of 5 seconds through the center of gravity of the toy and maintained for 1 minute.
 (d) Stability. A toy shall not overturn while resting in an upright position on a flat surface inclined 15° from horizontal. No spillage of molten material or hot liquids from containers shall occur while the toy is operating in this position under normal conditions of use. During this test, casters, if any, shall be in the position most likely to result in tipping, but shall not be artificially held in one position to prevent a natural rotation to another position.
 (e) Electrical—(1) Power input. The actual current flow in a toy without a heating element shall not exceed 110 percent of the rated value, and shall not exceed 5.5 amperes, at rated voltage. The power input to a toy with a heating element shall not exceed 105 percent of the rated value at rated voltage. The power input rating of a toy employing one or more incandescent lamps as the only power-consuming components shall be considered to be the total rated wattage of such lamps. The rated voltage shall be considered to be the mean value of a marked voltage range.
 (2) Dielectric strength. (i) A toy shall be capable of withstanding without breakdown for 1 minute a 60-cycle-per-second (60 Hertz) essentially sinusoidal potential of 1,000 volts applied between live parts and any dead metal parts.
 (ii) If a toy employs a low-voltage secondary winding (either in the form of a conventional transformer or as an insulated coil of a motor), the toy shall also be capable of withstanding without breakdown for 1 minute a sinusoidal test potential applied between the high-voltage and low-voltage windings. The test potential shall be applied at the rated frequency of the toy and shall have a value of 1,000 volts plus twice the rated voltage of the high-voltage winding. The test potential shall be supplied from a suitable capacity-testing transformer, the output voltage of which can be regulated. The waveform of the test voltage shall approximate a sine wave as closely as possible.
 (iii) The applied test potential shall be increased rapidly and uniformly from zero until the required test value is reached and shall be held at that value for 1 minute. Unless otherwise specified, the toy shall be at the maximum operating temperature reached in normal use prior to conducting the tests.
 (iv) The dielectric strength requirements of this subparagraph may also be determined by subjecting the toy to a 60-cycle-per-second (60 Hertz) essentially sinusoidal potential of 1,200 volts for 1 second. If the dielectric strength is determined by this method, the toy need not be in a heated condition.
 (3) Leakage current and repeated dielectric withstand tests. (i) Both before and after being conditioned, a toy intended to operate from a source exceeding 42.4 volts peak shall:
 (A) Not have a leakage current exceeding 0.5 milliampere, except that during the interval beginning 5 seconds and terminating 10 minutes after the toy is first energized, the leakage current of toys with heating elements other than lamps shall not exceed 2.5 milliamperes; and
 (B) Comply with the requirements of a repeated dielectric withstand test both with and without preheating.
 (ii) All accessible parts of a toy shall be tested for leakage current. If an insulating material is used for the enclosure or part of the enclosure, the leakage current shall be measured using a metal foil with an area not exceeding 10 by 20 centimeters in contact with accessible surfaces of such insulating material. Where the accessible surface of insulating material is less than 10 by 20 centimeters, the metal foil shall be the same size as the surface. The metal foil shall be so applied that it will not affect the temperature of the toy. The accessible parts shall be tested individually, collectively, and from one part to another.
 (iii) Following the initial leakage current test, the toy shall be cooled down or heated up to 32 °C. (90 °F.). The toy shall then be conditioned for 48 hours in air at a temperature of 32° ±2 °C. (89.6° ±3.6 °F.) and with a relative humidity of 90-95 percent. The specified relative humidity shall be maintained inside a closed compartment in which a saturated solution of potassium sulphate is kept in a suitable container. Leakage current measurements shall be made, as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section and before the toy is energized, while the toy is in the humidity compartment.

 (iv) With the connections intended for the source of supply connected thereto and then connected to the ungrounded side of a power supply circuit having a voltage equal to 110 percent of the rated voltage of the toy, the leakage current through a noninductive 1,500-ohm resistor connected between the gounded side of the supply circuit and each dead metal part (accessible and inaccessible) shall, when stable, be measured in accordance with the test provisions established in ANSI Standard C 101.1-1971, “American National Standard for Leakage Current for Appliances,” approved November 17, 1970, which is incorporated by reference. Copies of this document are available from American National Standards Institute, 1430 Broadway, New York, New York 10018. This document is also available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register. These materials are incorporated as they exist in the edition which has been approved by the Director of the Federal Register and which has been filed with the Office of the Federal Register.

 (v) For a toy whose outer enclosure consists wholly or partly of insulating material, the term dead metal part means metal foil tightly wrapped around the exterior of the enclosure in a manner that covers, but does not enter into, any enclosure openings.
 (4) Motor operation. (i) A motor provided as part of a toy shall be capable of driving its maximum normal load in the toy without introducing any potentially hazardous condition. The performance of the toy shall be considered unacceptable if, during the test, temperatures in excess of those specified in § 1505.7 for Type D surfaces are attained on any accessible surface. The performance of the toy shall also be considered unacceptable if the rise in temperature during the test causes melting, scorching, embrittlement, or other evidence of thermal damage to the insulating material used to prevent exposure of live metal parts.
 (ii) A motor-operated toy shall be tested with the motor stalled if the construction of the toy is such that any person can touch moving parts associated with the motor from outside the toy. The performance of the toy shall be considered unacceptable if, during the test, temperatures higher than those specified in § 1505.8 are attained or if temperatures higher than those specified for Type C surfaces in § 1505.7 are attained on any accessible surface of the motor. (See also § 1505.50.)
 (5) Overload—(i) Motor. A motor-control switch that is a part of a toy shall be horsepower-rated to cover the load or shall be capable of performing acceptably when subjected to an overload test consisting of 50 cycles of operation by making and breaking the stalled-rotor current of the toy at maximum rated voltage. There shall be no electrical or mechanical failure nor any visible burning or pitting of the switch contacts as a result of this test.
 (ii) Switch. To determine if a motor-control switch is capable of performing acceptably when subjected to overload conditions, the toy shall be connected to a grounded supply circuit of rated frequency and maximum rated voltage with the rotor of the motor locked into position. During the test, exposed dead metal parts of the toy shall be connected to ground through a 3-ampere plug fuse such that any single pole, current-rupturing device will be located in the ungrounded conductor of the supply circuit. If the toy is intended for use on direct current, or on direct current as well as alternating current, the exposed dead metal parts of the toy shall be so connected as to be positive with respect to a single pole, current-rupturing device. The switch shall be operated at a rate of not more than 10 cycles per minute. The performance of the toy shall be considered unacceptable if the fuse in the grounding connection is blown during the test.
 (f) Hydrokinetic—(1) General. Electrically operated toy steam engines shall be capable of performing acceptably when subjected to the tests described in this paragraph.
 (2) Preliminary test. The ultimate strength of the boiler assembly shall first be determined by applying a hydrostatic pressure to the boiler with all openings blocked (the pressure-relief valve, steam exhausts, and any whistle or other accessory shall be removed and the resulting openings sealed); however, a water or other type of gage shall be left in place. The hydrostatic pressure shall be applied slowly and the ultimate value which is attained shall be recorded.
 (3) Pressure-relief test. A pressure gage shall be connected to the boiler assembly which shall then be operated normally. The pressure at which the pressure-relief valve functions shall be noted while the engine is shut off (if a shutoff valve is provided) and with the whistle, if any, turned off. The test shall be discontinued and shall be considered a failure if the observed pressure exceeds one-fifth the value attained in the preliminary test described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
 (4) Operating pressure test. If the boiler is still intact and no failure has occurred, the pressure-relief valve shall then be rendered inoperable and all other valves (such as a whistle and exhaust from the assembly) shall be tightly closed. Operations shall be continued until the pressure becomes constant. This test shall be discontinued and shall be considered a failure if the observed pressure exceeds one-third the value attained in the preliminary test described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. During this test, all valves, gaskets, joints, and similar components shall be sufficiently tightened to prevent leakage. Rupture of the boiler or of any other fittings supplied with the engine shall be considered a failure.
 (5) Hydrostatic test. If there has been no failure, two previous untested toys shall withstand for 1 minute a hydrostatic pressure of 5 times the pressure at which the safety valve operated or 3 times the constant pressure observed with the pressure-relief valve inoperable, whichever is greater. During this test, all openings shall be blocked (the pressure-relief valve, steam exhaust from the assembly, and any whistle or other outlet); however, a water or other type of gage shall remain in place. Rupture of the boiler or of a gage shall be considered a failure.
 (g) Thermal—(1) General. The normal operation of a toy includes performance in normal use and after being subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse likely to produce the highest temperatures or, in the case of motor-operated toys, the load that most closely approximates the severest conditions of normal use or reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse.
 (2) Classification. Parts or surfaces of a toy are classified according to their use or function as follows (for the purposes of paragraph (g)(2) (v), (vi), and (vii) of this section, accessibility shall be defined as the ability to reach a heated surface with a 1/4-inch-diameter rod 3 inches long as described in § 1505.51(a)):
 (i) Type A. A part or surface of a toy (such as a handle) likely to be grasped by the hand or fingers for the purpose of carrying the toy or lifting a separable lid.
 (ii) Type B. A part or surface of a toy that is (a) part of a handle, knob, or similar component, as in Type A (described in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section), but which is not normally grasped or contacted by the hand or fingers for carrying (including parts of a handle within 7/16 inch of the surface to which the handle is attached and parts of a finger knob within 1/4 inch of the surface to which the knob is attached, if the remainder of the knob is large enough to be grasped), or (b) a handle, knob, or part that may be touched but which need not be grasped for carrying the toy or lifting a lid, door, or cover (e.g., support part of a handle or knob).
 (iii) Type C. A part or surface of a toy that can be touched by casual contact or that can be touched without employing the aid of a common household tool (screwdriver, pliers, or other similar household tool) and that is either (a) a surface that performs an intended heating function (e.g., the soleplate of a flat-iron, a cooking surface, or a heating element surface), or (b) a material heated by the element and intended to be used as the product of the toy, excluding pans, dishes, or other containers used to hold the material to be cooked or baked if a common utensil or other device is supplied with the toy and specific instructions are established for using such a device to remove the container from the heated area. (See also § 1505.51(b))
 
 (iv) Type C marked. A Type C surface which has been marked with a precautionary statement of thermal hazards in accordance with § 1505.3(e)(2). (See also § 1505.51(b))
 (v) Type D. An accessible part or surface of a toy other than Types A, B, C or E (see paragraph (g)(2) (i), (ii), (iii) and (vii) of this paragraph).
 (vi) Type D marked. A Type D surface which has been marked with a precautionary statement of thermal hazards in accordance with § 1505.3(e)(2).
 (vii) Type E. A heated surface in an oven or other article that is inaccessible or protected by an electrical-thermal safety interlock. Such interlocks shall prohibit the operation of a heating device whenever such surfaces are accessible and shall not allow accessibility to such surfaces until the temperatures of those surfaces have been reduced to levels below those established for Type D surfaces (paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section).
 (3) Requirements. When tested under the conditions described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, a toy shall not attain a temperature at any point sufficiently high to constitute a fire hazard or to adversely affect any materials employed and shall not show a maximum temperature higher than those established by §§ 1505.7 and 1505.8. These maximum surface temperature requirements are not applicable to educational-or hobby-type products such as lead-casting sets and wood-burning tools which are appropriately labeled on the shelf pack or package as being intended only for children over 12 years of age provided that the maximum surface temperature of any such toy does not exceed that reasonably required to accomplish the intended technical effect. Such toys shall be provided with specific instructions and the warning statements required by and in accordance with § 1505.3 (d) and (e), and shall be appropriately identified as educational or hobby-type products.
 (4) Test conditions—(i) General. Tests shall be conducted while the toy is connected to a circuit of 60-cycle-per-second (60 Hertz) current using the materials supplied with the toy or using materials otherwise intended to be used with the toy. Following such tests, the toy shall be energized for a 6-hour period to determine that no hazardous conditions would result from unattended use of the toy.
 (ii) Temperature. Normally, tests shall be performed at an ambient (room) temperature of 25 °C. (77 °F.); however, a test may be conducted at any ambient temperature within the range of 21° to 30 °C. (69.8° to 86 °F.).
 (iii) Voltage. The toy shall be tested at the voltage indicated in the manufacturer's rating or at 120 volts, whichever is greater.
 (5) Temperature measurements—(i) General. Temperatures shall be measured by means of instruments utilizing thermocouples of No. 30 AWG (American Wire Gage) wire (either copper and constantan or iron and constantan) and potentiometer-type instruments that are accurate and are calibrated in accordance with current good laboratory practices. The thermocouple wire shall conform with the requirements for “special” thermocouples as listed in the table of limits of error of thermocouples (Table VIII) in ANSI Standard C 96.1-1964, “American Standard for Temperature Measurement Thermocouples,” approved June 9, 1964, which is incorporated by reference. Copies of this document are available from American National Standards Institute, 1430 Broadway, New York, New York 10018. This standard is also available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register. These materials are incorporated as they exist in the edition which has been approved by the Director of the Federal Register and which has been filed with the Office of the Federal Register.
 (ii) Test procedures. The thermocouple junction and adjacent thermocouple lead wire shall be securely held in good thermal contact with the surface of the material whose temperature is being measured. In most cases, good thermal contact will result from securely taping or cementing the thermocouple in place. If a metal surface is involved, brazing or soldering the thermocouple to the metal may be necessary. The surface temperatures of a toy shall be measured with the toy operating in any unattended condition (e.g., with and without opening and closing doors or covers) for a sufficient period of time to allow temperatures to become constant, or, in the case of a toy with a thermostatically controlled heating element, for a sufficient period of time to determine the maximum surface temperature attained. A temperature shall be considered to be constant when three successive readings taken at 15-minute intervals indicate no change.
 (iii) Heating devices. Toy ovens, casting toys, popcorn and candy makers, and other toys requiring the insertion of any materials or substances shall be additionally tested by feeding crumpled strips of newspaper and tissue paper into or onto the toy in place of the intended materials or substances. The test strips shall be conditioned for at least 48 hours in air at a temperature of 25° ±4 °C. (77° ±7 °F.) and a relative humidity of 50 percent ±5 percent. The test strips shall be 2 inches wide by 8 inches long before crumpling. The crumpled paper shall occupy not more than 25 percent of the accessible volume. The performance of the toy shall be considered unacceptable if flaming occurs within a 60-minute period following the attainment of normal operating temperatures. If a light bulb is used for heating purposes, the test shall be conducted using the largest wattage bulb that can be easily inserted into the socket.
 (h) Strain-relief test. (1) The strain-relief means provided on the flexible power cord of a toy shall be capable of withstanding a direct pull of 35 pounds applied to the cord for 2 minutes without displacement of the strain-relief unit or a deformation of the anchoring surface that would produce a stress which would result in a potentially hazardous condition. A 35-pound weight shall be attached to the cord and supported by the toy in such a manner that the strain-relief means is stressed from any angle that the construction of the toy permits. The test shall be conducted with the electrical connection within the toy disconnected.
 (2) The initial 2-minute test shall be conducted with the force vector parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cord and perpendicular to the anchoring surface of the strain-relief unit. Each test at other angles of stress shall be conducted for periods of 1 minute. The strain-relief means is not acceptable if, at the point of disconnection of the cord, there is any movement of the cord to indicate that stress would have resulted on the conections.
 (3) Except for toys weighing more than 10 pounds, the strain-relief unit and its support base shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that no indication of stress would result which would produce a hazard when the cord is held firmly in place 3 feet from the strain-relief unit and the toy is dropped the 3 feet at any angle.

§ 1505.50 Stalled motor testing
 (a) § 1505.6(e)(4)(ii) requires that a motor-operated toy be tested with the motor stalled if the construction of the toy is such that any person can touch moving parts associated with the motor from outside the toy. The performance of the toy shall be considered unacceptable if, during the test, temperatures higher than those specified in § 1505.8 are attained or if temperatures higher than those specified for Type C surfaces in § 1505.7 are attained on any accessible surface of the motor.

 (b) To determine if a moving part associated with the motor can be touched from outside the toy, the Commission staff will use a 1/4-inch diameter rod, as referenced in § 1505.4(h)(1). If the rod, when inserted into openings in the toy, can touch any moving part associated with the motor, the toy will be tested with the motor stalled.
 
 (c) The requirement that temperatures higher than those specified in § 1505.8 not be attained applies to those internal components which are described in § 1505.8. Additionally, temperatures of accessible surfaces shall not exceed those specified for Type C surfaces in § 1505.7.
 (Secs. 2(q)(1)(A), 2(r), 3(e), 10(a), 74 Stat. 372, 378, 80 Stat. 1303-1304, 83 Stat. 187-189 (15 U.S.C. 1261, 1262, 1269); sec. 30(a), 86 Stat. 1231 (15 U.S.C. 2079(a)))
 
 § 1505.51 Hot surfaces
 (a) Test probe. Section 1505.6(g)(2) defines accessibility, for certain paragraphs, as the ability to reach a heated surface with a 1/4-inch-diameter rod 3 inches long. To test for accessibility using this test probe, it shall be inserted no more than 3 inches into any opening in the toy. Unless the probe contacts a surface within 3 inches of the plane of the toy's opening, that surface is not accessible.
 (b) Accessibility of Type C and C-marked surfaces.

 (a) Minimum size limits for imported spiny lobster. There are two minimum size limits that apply to importation of spiny lobster into the United States—one that applies any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States other than Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, and a more restrictive minimum size limit that applies to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 (1) No person may import a spiny lobster with less than a 5-ounce (142-gram) tail weight into any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States excluding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a 5-ounce (142-gram) tail weight is defined as a tail that weighs 4.2-5.4 ounces (119-153 grams). If the documentation accompanying an imported spiny lobster (including but not limited to product packaging, customs entry forms, bills of lading, brokerage forms, or commercial invoices) indicates that the product does not satisfy the minimum tail-weight requirement, the person importing such spiny lobster has the burden to prove that such spiny lobster actually does satisfy the minimum tail-weight requirement or that such spiny lobster has a tail length of 5.5 inches (13.97 cm) or greater or that such spiny lobster has or had a carapace length of greater than 3.0 inches (7.62 cm). If the imported product itself does not satisfy the minimum tail-weight requirement, the person importing such spiny lobster has the burden to prove that such spiny lobster has a tail length of 5.5 inches (13.97 cm) or greater or that such spiny lobster has or had a carapace length of greater than 3.0 inches (7.62 cm). If the burden is satisfied, such spiny lobster will be considered to be in compliance with the minimum 5-ounce (142-gram) tail-weight requirement.
 (2) See § 622.458 regarding a more restrictive minimum size limit that applies to spiny lobster imported into Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 (b) Additional spiny lobster import prohibitions—(1) Prohibition related to tail meat. No person may import into any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States spiny lobster tail meat that is not in whole tail form with the exoskeleton attached.
 (2) Prohibitions related to egg-bearing spiny lobster. No person may import into any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States spiny lobster with eggs attached or spiny lobster from which eggs or pleopods (swimmerets) have been removed or stripped. Pleopods (swimmerets) are the first five pairs of abdominal appendages.

United States of America,World [Valid From: 09 Apr 2010],E1,Non-automatic import-licensing procedures other than authorizations covered under SPS and TBT chapters,"(a) General. (1) A dealer intending to import or re-export AMLR must obtain an AMLR dealer permit valid for one year. Preapproval from NMFS is required for each shipment of frozen Dissostichus species. The permit holder may only conduct those specific activities stipulated by the permit.

 (2) An AMLR may be imported into the United States if its harvest has been authorized by a U.S.-issued individual permit issued under § 300.112(a)(1) or its importation has been authorized by a NMFS-issued dealer permit and preapproval issued under § 300.114(a)(1). AMLRs may not be released for entry into the United States unless accompanied by the harvesting permit or the individual permit or dealer permit and, in the case of frozen Dissostichus species, the preapproval certification granted by NMFS to allow import. NMFS will only accept electronic catch documents for toothfish imports.
 (3) In no event may a marine mammal be imported into the United States unless authorized and accompanied by an import permit issued under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/or the Endangered Species Act.
 (4) A dealer permit or preapproval issued under this section does not authorize the harvest or transshipment of any AMLR by or to a vessel of the United States.
 (b) Application. Application forms for AMLR dealer permits and preapproval are available from NMFS. With the exception of the U.S. Customs 7501 entry number, a complete and accurate application must be received by NMFS for each preapproval at least 15 working days before the anticipated date of the first receipt, importation, or re-export. Dealers must supply the U.S. Customs 7501 entry number at least three working days prior to a Dissostichus species shipment's arrival.
 (c) Fees. A fee to recover the administrative expenses associated with processing preapproval applications will be charged. The amount of the fee will be determined in accordance with procedures specified in the NOAA Finance Handbook for calculating administrative costs of special products and services. The fee is specified with the preapproval application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application and be paid by check, draft, or money order.
 (d) Issuance. NMFS may issue a dealer permit or preapproval if it determines that the activity proposed by the dealer meets the requirements of the Act and that the resources were not or will not be harvested in violation of any CCAMLR conservation measure or in violation of any regulation in this subpart. No preapproval will be issued for Dissostichus species without verifiable documentation, to include VMS reports with vessel location and messages, of the use of real-time C-VMS port-to-port by the vessel that harvested such Dissostichus species, except for Dissostichus species harvested during fishing trips that began prior to September 24, 2007.
 (e) Duration. A permit issued under this section is valid from its date of issuance to its date of expiration unless it is revoked or suspended. A preapproval is valid until the product is imported (and re-exported, if applicable).
 (f) Transfer. A permit issued under this section is not transferable or assignable.
 
 (g) Changes in information—(1) Pending applications. Applicants for permits and preapproval under this section must report in writing to NMFS any change in the information submitted in their permit and preapproval applications. The processing period for the application may be extended as necessary to review and consider the change.
 (2) Issued permits and preapprovals. Any entity issued a permit or preapproval under this section must report in writing to NMFS any changes in previously submitted information. Any changes that would result in a change in the receipt or importation authorized by the preapproval, such as harvesting vessel or country of origin, type and quantity of the resource to be received or imported, and Convention statistical subarea from which the resource was harvested, must be proposed in writing to NMFS and may not be undertaken unless authorized by NMFS through issuance of a revised or new preapproval.
 (h) Revision, suspension, or revocation. A permit or preapproval issued under this section may be revised, suspended, or revoked, based upon a violation of the permit, the Act, or this subpart. Failure to report a change in the information contained in a permit or preapproval application voids the application, permit, or preapproval as applicable. Title 15 CFR part 904 governs permit sanctions under this subpart.
 (i) Exception. Preapproval is not required for shipments of fresh Dissostichus species. A report of a shipment of fresh Dissostichus species must be completed and submitted to NMFS within 24 hours following import.
 (j) SVDCD. Dealer permits will not be issued for Dissostichus spp. offered for sale or other disposition under a Specially Validated DCD.
 (k) Registered agent. Foreign entities shall, as a condition of possessing a dealer permit, designate and maintain a registered agent within the United States that is authorized to accept service of process on behalf of that entity. Foreign based importers of record may identify to NMFS the registered agent identified for Customs Service purposes.","Antarctic Marine Living Resources, except fresh Dissostichus species","010612(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 010620(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 010639(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 010649(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 010690(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 020840(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 020890(Only birds found south of the Antarctic Convergen...), 021092(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 0301(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 0302(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 0303(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 0304(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 0305(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 0306(Only crustaceans found south of the Antarctic Con...), 0307(Only molluscs found south of the Antarctic Conver...), 0308(Only aquatic invertebrates other than crustaceans...), 040719(Only birds found south of the Antarctic Convergen...), 040790(Only birds found south of the Antarctic Convergen...), 0410(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 0504(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 0505(Only birds found south of the Antarctic Convergen...), 0506(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 0507(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 0510(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 051191(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 051199(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 121221(Only seaweeds and other algae found south of the ...), 121229(Only seaweeds and other algae found south of the ...), 150410(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 150420(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 150430(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 152190(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 1603(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 1604(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 2104(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 2106(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 230120(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 2309(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 9705(Only those from living organisms found south of t...)",Fish and Wildlife Service,Title 50 - Wildlife and Fisheries.

United States of America,World [Valid From: 09 Apr 2010],E1,Non-automatic import-licensing procedures other than authorizations covered under SPS and TBT chapters,"(a) General. (1) A dealer intending to import or re-export AMLR must obtain an AMLR dealer permit valid for one year. Preapproval from NMFS is required for each shipment of frozen Dissostichus species. The permit holder may only conduct those specific activities stipulated by the permit.

 (2) An AMLR may be imported into the United States if its harvest has been authorized by a U.S.-issued individual permit issued under § 300.112(a)(1) or its importation has been authorized by a NMFS-issued dealer permit and preapproval issued under § 300.114(a)(1). AMLRs may not be released for entry into the United States unless accompanied by the harvesting permit or the individual permit or dealer permit and, in the case of frozen Dissostichus species, the preapproval certification granted by NMFS to allow import. NMFS will only accept electronic catch documents for toothfish imports.
 (3) In no event may a marine mammal be imported into the United States unless authorized and accompanied by an import permit issued under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/or the Endangered Species Act.
 (4) A dealer permit or preapproval issued under this section does not authorize the harvest or transshipment of any AMLR by or to a vessel of the United States.
 (b) Application. Application forms for AMLR dealer permits and preapproval are available from NMFS. With the exception of the U.S. Customs 7501 entry number, a complete and accurate application must be received by NMFS for each preapproval at least 15 working days before the anticipated date of the first receipt, importation, or re-export. Dealers must supply the U.S. Customs 7501 entry number at least three working days prior to a Dissostichus species shipment's arrival.
 (c) Fees. A fee to recover the administrative expenses associated with processing preapproval applications will be charged. The amount of the fee will be determined in accordance with procedures specified in the NOAA Finance Handbook for calculating administrative costs of special products and services. The fee is specified with the preapproval application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application and be paid by check, draft, or money order.
 (d) Issuance. NMFS may issue a dealer permit or preapproval if it determines that the activity proposed by the dealer meets the requirements of the Act and that the resources were not or will not be harvested in violation of any CCAMLR conservation measure or in violation of any regulation in this subpart. No preapproval will be issued for Dissostichus species without verifiable documentation, to include VMS reports with vessel location and messages, of the use of real-time C-VMS port-to-port by the vessel that harvested such Dissostichus species, except for Dissostichus species harvested during fishing trips that began prior to September 24, 2007.
 (e) Duration. A permit issued under this section is valid from its date of issuance to its date of expiration unless it is revoked or suspended. A preapproval is valid until the product is imported (and re-exported, if applicable).
 (f) Transfer. A permit issued under this section is not transferable or assignable.
 
 (g) Changes in information—(1) Pending applications. Applicants for permits and preapproval under this section must report in writing to NMFS any change in the information submitted in their permit and preapproval applications. The processing period for the application may be extended as necessary to review and consider the change.
 (2) Issued permits and preapprovals. Any entity issued a permit or preapproval under this section must report in writing to NMFS any changes in previously submitted information. Any changes that would result in a change in the receipt or importation authorized by the preapproval, such as harvesting vessel or country of origin, type and quantity of the resource to be received or imported, and Convention statistical subarea from which the resource was harvested, must be proposed in writing to NMFS and may not be undertaken unless authorized by NMFS through issuance of a revised or new preapproval.
 (h) Revision, suspension, or revocation. A permit or preapproval issued under this section may be revised, suspended, or revoked, based upon a violation of the permit, the Act, or this subpart. Failure to report a change in the information contained in a permit or preapproval application voids the application, permit, or preapproval as applicable. Title 15 CFR part 904 governs permit sanctions under this subpart.
 (i) Exception. Preapproval is not required for shipments of fresh Dissostichus species. A report of a shipment of fresh Dissostichus species must be completed and submitted to NMFS within 24 hours following import.
 (j) SVDCD. Dealer permits will not be issued for Dissostichus spp. offered for sale or other disposition under a Specially Validated DCD.
 (k) Registered agent. Foreign entities shall, as a condition of possessing a dealer permit, designate and maintain a registered agent within the United States that is authorized to accept service of process on behalf of that entity. Foreign based importers of record may identify to NMFS the registered agent identified for Customs Service purposes.","Antarctic Marine Living Resources, except fresh Dissostichus species","010612(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 010620(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 010639(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 010649(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 010690(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 020840(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 020890(Only birds found south of the Antarctic Convergen...), 021092(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 0301(Only those animals found south of the Antarctic C...), 0302(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 0303(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 0304(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 0305(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 0306(Only crustaceans found south of the Antarctic Con...), 0307(Only molluscs found south of the Antarctic Conver...), 0308(Only aquatic invertebrates other than crustaceans...), 040719(Only birds found south of the Antarctic Convergen...), 040790(Only birds found south of the Antarctic Convergen...), 0410(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 0504(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 0505(Only birds found south of the Antarctic Convergen...), 0506(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 0507(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 0510(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 051191(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 051199(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 121221(Only seaweeds and other algae found south of the ...), 121229(Only seaweeds and other algae found south of the ...), 150410(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 150420(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 150430(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 152190(Only from those animals found south of the Antarc...), 1603(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 1604(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 2104(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 2106(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 230120(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 2309(Only from fish found south of the Antarctic Conve...), 9705(Only those from living organisms found south of t...)",Fish and Wildlife Service,Title 50 - Wildlife and Fisheries.

Consent must be obtained from the competent authorities of the relevant OECD countries of import and transit prior to exporting hazardous waste destined for recovery operations subject to this subpart. Hazardous wastes subject to the Amber control procedures are subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section; and wastes not identified on any list are subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
 (b) Amber wastes. Exports of hazardous wastes from the United States as described in § 262.80(a) that are subject to the Amber control procedures are prohibited unless the notification and consent requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met.
 (1) Transactions requiring specific consent:
 (i) Notification. At least forty-five (45) days prior to commencement of each transboundary movement, the exporter must provide written notification in English of the proposed transboundary movement to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Federal Activities, International Compliance Assurance Division (2254A), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460, with the words “Attention: OECD Export Notification” prominently displayed on the envelope. This notification must include all of the information identified in paragraph (d) of this section. In cases where wastes having similar physical and chemical characteristics, the same United Nations classification, the same RCRA waste codes, and are to be sent periodically to the same recovery facility by the same exporter, the exporter may submit one general notification of intent to export these wastes in multiple shipments during a period of up to one (1) year. Even when a general notification is used for multiple shipments, each shipment still must be accompanied by its own movement document pursuant to § 262.84.
 (ii) Tacit consent. If no objection has been lodged by any countries concerned (i.e., exporting, importing, or transit) to a notification provided pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section within thirty (30) days after the date of issuance of the Acknowledgement of Receipt of notification by the competent authority of the country of import, the transboundary movement may commence. Tacit consent expires one (1) calendar year after the close of the thirty (30) day period; renotification and renewal of all consents is required for exports after that date.
 (iii) Written consent. If the competent authorities of all the relevant OECD importing and transit countries provide written consent in a period less than thirty (30) days, the transboundary movement may commence immediately after all necessary consents are received. Written consent expires for each relevant OECD importing and transit country one (1) calendar year after the date of that country's consent unless otherwise specified; renotification and renewal of each expired consent is required for exports after that date.
 (2) Transboundary movements to facilities pre-approved by the competent authorities of the importing countries to accept specific wastes for recovery:
 (i) Notification. The exporter must provide EPA a notification that contains all the information identified in paragraph (d) of this section in English, at least ten (10) days in advance of commencing shipment to a pre-approved facility. The notification must indicate that the recovery facility is pre-approved, and may apply to a single specific shipment or to multiple shipments as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. This information must be sent to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Federal Activities, International Compliance Assurance Division (2254A), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460, with the words “OECD Export Notification—Pre-approved Facility” prominently displayed on the envelope. General notifications that cover multiple shipments as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section may cover a period of up to three (3) years. Even when a general notification is used for multiple shipments, each shipment still must be accompanied by its own movement document pursuant to § 262.84.
 (ii) Exports to pre-approved facilities may take place after the elapse of seven (7) working days from the issuance of an Acknowledgement of Receipt of the notification by the competent authority of the country of import unless the exporter has received information indicating that the competent authority of any countries concerned objects to the shipment.
 (c) Wastes not covered in the OECD Green and Amber lists. Wastes destined for recovery operations, that have not been assigned to the OECD Green and Amber lists, incorporated by reference in § 262.89(d), but which are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a), are subject to the notification and consent requirements established for the Amber control procedures in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Wastes destined for recovery operations, that have not been assigned to the OECD Green and Amber lists incorporated by reference in § 262.89(d), and are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined by § 262.80(a) are subject to the Green control procedures.","Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materials Utilized for Precious Metal Recovery and universal waste management (batteries, pesticides, mercury-containing equipment and lamps)","1522(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 230310(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 230320(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2304(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2305(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2306(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2307(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 240130(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2620(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2621(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 271091(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 271099(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 271390(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 300692(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 3825(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 4004(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 4017(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 411520(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 440139(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 440140(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 450190(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 4707(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7001(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7112(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720410(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720421(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720429(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720430(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720441(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720449(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7404(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7503(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7602(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7802(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7902(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 8002(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810197(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810297(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810330(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810420(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810530(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 8106(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810730(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810830(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810930(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811020(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811213(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811222(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811252(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811292(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 8113(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 854810(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...)",Environmental Protection Agency,Title 40 - Protection of Environment; Part 262 - STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE - Subpart H—Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste for Recovery Within the OECD,"75 FR 1253, Jan. 8, 2010",08-01-2010,,,1078576#40 CFR 262,No objective specified,Environmental preservation

 (b) Amber wastes. Exports of hazardous wastes from the United States as described in § 262.80(a) that are subject to the Amber control procedures are prohibited unless the notification and consent requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met.
 (1) Transactions requiring specific consent:
 (i) Notification. At least forty-five (45) days prior to commencement of each transboundary movement, the exporter must provide written notification in English of the proposed transboundary movement to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Federal Activities, International Compliance Assurance Division (2254A), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460, with the words “Attention: OECD Export Notification” prominently displayed on the envelope. This notification must include all of the information identified in paragraph (d) of this section. In cases where wastes having similar physical and chemical characteristics, the same United Nations classification, the same RCRA waste codes, and are to be sent periodically to the same recovery facility by the same exporter, the exporter may submit one general notification of intent to export these wastes in multiple shipments during a period of up to one (1) year. Even when a general notification is used for multiple shipments, each shipment still must be accompanied by its own movement document pursuant to § 262.84.
 (ii) Tacit consent. If no objection has been lodged by any countries concerned (i.e., exporting, importing, or transit) to a notification provided pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section within thirty (30) days after the date of issuance of the Acknowledgement of Receipt of notification by the competent authority of the country of import, the transboundary movement may commence. Tacit consent expires one (1) calendar year after the close of the thirty (30) day period; renotification and renewal of all consents is required for exports after that date.
 (iii) Written consent. If the competent authorities of all the relevant OECD importing and transit countries provide written consent in a period less than thirty (30) days, the transboundary movement may commence immediately after all necessary consents are received. Written consent expires for each relevant OECD importing and transit country one (1) calendar year after the date of that country's consent unless otherwise specified; renotification and renewal of each expired consent is required for exports after that date.
 (2) Transboundary movements to facilities pre-approved by the competent authorities of the importing countries to accept specific wastes for recovery:
 (i) Notification. The exporter must provide EPA a notification that contains all the information identified in paragraph (d) of this section in English, at least ten (10) days in advance of commencing shipment to a pre-approved facility. The notification must indicate that the recovery facility is pre-approved, and may apply to a single specific shipment or to multiple shipments as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. This information must be sent to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Federal Activities, International Compliance Assurance Division (2254A), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460, with the words “OECD Export Notification—Pre-approved Facility” prominently displayed on the envelope. General notifications that cover multiple shipments as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section may cover a period of up to three (3) years. Even when a general notification is used for multiple shipments, each shipment still must be accompanied by its own movement document pursuant to § 262.84.
 (ii) Exports to pre-approved facilities may take place after the elapse of seven (7) working days from the issuance of an Acknowledgement of Receipt of the notification by the competent authority of the country of import unless the exporter has received information indicating that the competent authority of any countries concerned objects to the shipment.

 (iv) A copy of each certificate of recovery sent by the recovery facility to the exporter for at least three (3) years from the date that the recovery facility completed processing the waste shipment.
 (2) The periods of retention referred to in this section are extended automatically during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator.

§ 262.80 Applicability.
 (a) The requirements of this subpart apply to imports and exports of wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures and are destined for recovery operations in the countries listed in § 262.58(a)(1). A waste is considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures if the waste:
 (1) Meets the Federal definition of hazardous waste in 40 CFR 261.3; and
 (2) Is subject to either the Federal RCRA manifesting requirements at 40 CFR part 262, subpart B, the universal waste management standards of 40 CFR part 273, State requirements analogous to 40 CFR part 273, the export requirements in the spent lead-acid battery management standards of 40 CFR part 266, subpart G, or State requirements analogous to the export requirements in 40 CFR part 266, subpart G.

§ 262.82 General conditions.
 (a) Scope. The level of control for exports and imports of waste is indicated by assignment of the waste to either a list of wastes subject to the Green control procedures or a list of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures and by the national procedures of the United States, as defined in § 262.80(a). The OECD Green and Amber lists are incorporated by reference in § 262.89(d).
 (1) Listed wastes subject to the Green control procedures. (i) Green wastes that are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a) are subject to existing controls normally applied to commercial transactions.
 (ii) Green wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures set forth in this subpart.
 (2) Listed wastes subject to the Amber control procedures.(i) Amber wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures set forth in this subpart.
 (ii) Amber wastes that are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a), are subject to the Amber control procedures in the United States, even if they are imported to or exported from a designated OECD Member country listed in § 262.58(a)(1) that does not consider the waste to be hazardous. In such an event, the responsibilities of the Amber control procedures shift as provided:
 (A) For U.S. exports, the United States shall issue an acknowledgement of receipt and assume other responsibilities of the competent authority of the country of import.
 (B) For U.S. imports, the U.S. recovery facility/importer and the United States shall assume the obligations associated with the Amber control procedures that normally apply to the exporter and country of export, respectively.

 (iii) Amber wastes that are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a), but are considered hazardous by an OECD Member country are subject to the Amber control procedures in the OECD Member country that considers the waste hazardous. All responsibilities of the U.S. importer/exporter shift to the importer/exporter of the OECD Member country that considers the waste hazardous unless the parties make other arrangements through contracts.
 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(2):

 Some wastes subject to the Amber control procedures are not listed or otherwise identified as hazardous under RCRA, and therefore are not subject to the Amber control procedures of this subpart. Regardless of the status of the waste under RCRA, however, other Federal environmental statutes (e.g., the Toxic Substances Control Act) restrict certain waste imports or exports. Such restrictions continue to apply with regard to this subpart.
 
 
 (3) Procedures for mixtures of wastes. (i) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more other Green wastes such that the resulting mixture is not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a) shall be subject to the Green control procedures, provided the composition of this mixture does not impair its environmentally sound recovery.
 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(3)(i):
 The regulated community should note that some OECD Member countries may require, by domestic law, that mixtures of different Green wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures.
 
 

 (ii) A Green waste that is mixed with one or more Amber wastes, in any amount, de minimis or otherwise, or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes, such that the resulting waste mixture is considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a) are subject to the Amber control procedures, provided the composition of this mixture does not impair its environmentally sound recovery.
 
 
 Note to paragraph (a)(3)(ii):

 The regulated community should note that some OECD Member countries may require, by domestic law, that a mixture of a Green waste and more than a de minimis amount of an Amber waste or a mixture of two or more Amber wastes be subject to the Amber control procedures.
 
 
 (4) Wastes not yet assigned to an OECD waste list are eligible for transboundary movements, as follows:
 (i) If such wastes are considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a), such wastes are subject to the Amber control procedures.
 (ii) If such wastes are not considered hazardous under U.S. national procedures as defined in § 262.80(a), such wastes are subject to the Green control procedures.
 (b) General conditions applicable to transboundary movements of hazardous waste: (1) The waste must be destined for recovery operations at a facility that, under applicable domestic law, is operating or is authorized to operate in the importing country;

 (2) The transboundary movement must be in compliance with applicable international transport agreements; and
 
 
 Note to paragraph (b)(2):
 These international agreements include, but are not limited to, the Chicago Convention (1944), ADR (1957), ADNR (1970), MARPOL Convention (1973/1978), SOLAS Convention (1974), IMDG Code (1985), COTIF (1985), and RID (1985).
 
 
 (3) Any transit of waste through a non-OECD Member country must be conducted in compliance with all applicable international and national laws and regulations.

(e) Duty to return wastes subject to the Amber control procedures from a country of transit. When a transboundary movement of wastes subject to the Amber control procedures does not comply with the requirements of the notification and movement documents or otherwise constitutes illegal shipment, and if alternative arrangements cannot be made to recover these wastes in an environmentally sound manner, the waste must be returned to the country of export. The following provisions apply as appropriate:
 (1) Return from the United States (as country of transit) to the country of export: The U.S. transporter must inform EPA at the specified address in § 262.83(b)(1)(i) of the need to return the shipment. EPA will then inform the competent authority of the country of export, citing the reason(s) for returning the waste. The U.S. transporter must complete the return within ninety (90) days from the time EPA informs the country of export of the need to return the waste, unless informed in writing by EPA of another timeframe agreed to by the concerned Member countries.
 (2) Return from the country of transit to the United States (as country of export): The U.S. exporter must provide for the return of the hazardous waste shipment within ninety (90) days from the time the competent authority of the country of transit informs EPA of the need to return the waste or such other period of time as the concerned Member countries agree. The U.S. exporter must submit an exception report to EPA in accordance with § 262.87(b).
 (f) Requirements for wastes destined for and received by R12 and R13 facilities. The transboundary movement of wastes destined for R12 and R13 operations must comply with all Amber control procedures for notification and consent as set forth in § 262.83 and for the movement document as set forth in § 262.84. Additional responsibilities of R12/R13 facilities include:
 (1) Indicating in the notification document the foreseen recovery facility or facilities where the subsequent R1-R11 recovery operation takes place or may take place.
 (2) Within three (3) days of the receipt of the wastes by the R12/R13 recovery facility or facilities, the facility(ies) shall return a signed copy of the movement document to the exporter and to the competent authorities of the countries of export and import. The facility(ies) shall retain the original of the movement document for three (3) years.
 (3) As soon as possible, but no later than thirty (30) days after the completion of the R12/R13 recovery operation and no later than one (1) calendar year following the receipt of the waste, the R12 or R13 facility(ies) shall send a certificate of recovery to the foreign exporter and to the competent authority of the country of export and to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Federal Activities, International Compliance Assurance Division (2254A), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. Washington, DC 20460, by mail, e-mail without digital signature followed by mail, or fax followed by mail.
 (4) When an R12/R13 recovery facility delivers wastes for recovery to an R1-R11 recovery facility located in the country of import, it shall obtain as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) calendar year following delivery of the waste, a certification from the R1-R11 facility that recovery of the wastes at that facility has been completed. The R12/R13 facility must promptly transmit the applicable certification to the competent authorities of the countries of import and export, identifying the transboundary movements to which the certification pertain.
 (5) When an R12/R13 recovery facility delivers wastes for recovery to an R1-R11 recovery facility located:
 (i) In the initial country of export, Amber control procedures apply, including a new notification;
 (ii) In a third country other than the initial country of export, Amber control procedures apply, with the additional provision that the competent authority of the initial country of export shall also be notified of the transboundary movement.

§ 262.85 Contracts.
 (a) Transboundary movements of hazardous wastes subject to the Amber control procedures are prohibited unless they occur under the terms of a valid written contract, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity). Such contracts or equivalent arrangements must be executed by the exporter and the owner or operator of the recovery facility, and must specify responsibilities for each. Contracts or equivalent arrangements are valid for the purposes of this section only if persons assuming obligations under the contracts or equivalent arrangements have appropriate legal status to conduct the operations specified in the contract or equivalent arrangements.
 (b) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must specify the name and EPA ID number, where available, of paragraph (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section:
 (1) The generator of each type of waste;
 
 (2) Each person who will have physical custody of the wastes;
 (3) Each person who will have legal control of the wastes; and
 (4) The recovery facility.
 (c) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must specify which party to the contract will assume responsibility for alternate management of the wastes if their disposition cannot be carried out as described in the notification of intent to export. In such cases, contracts must specify that:
 (1) The person having actual possession or physical control over the wastes will immediately inform the exporter and the competent authorities of the countries of export and import and, if the wastes are located in a country of transit, the competent authorities of that country; and
 (2) The person specified in the contract will assume responsibility for the adequate management of the wastes in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including, if necessary, arranging the return of wastes and, as the case may be, shall provide the notification for re-export.
 (d) Contracts must specify that the importer will provide the notification required in § 262.82(c) prior to the re-export of controlled wastes to a third country.

 (e) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must include provisions for financial guarantees, if required by the competent authorities of any countries concerned, in accordance with applicable national or international law requirements.
 
 
 Note to paragraph (e):
 Financial guarantees so required are intended to provide for alternate recycling, disposal or other means of sound management of the wastes in cases where arrangements for the shipment and the recovery operations cannot be carried out as foreseen. The United States does not require such financial guarantees at this time; however, some OECD Member countries do. It is the responsibility of the exporter to ascertain and comply with such requirements; in some cases, transporters or importers may refuse to enter into the necessary contracts absent specific references or certifications to financial guarantees.
 
 
 (f) Contracts or equivalent arrangements must contain provisions requiring each contracting party to comply with all applicable requirements of this subpart.

 (g) Upon request by EPA, U.S. exporters, importers, or recovery facilities must submit to EPA copies of contracts, chain of contracts, or equivalent arrangements (when the movement occurs between parties controlled by the same corporate or legal entity). Information contained in the contracts or equivalent arrangements for which a claim of confidentiality is asserted in accordance with 40 CFR 2.203(b) will be treated as confidential and will be disclosed by EPA only as provided in 40 CFR 260.2.

 Although the United States does not require routine submission of contracts at this time, the OECD Decision allows Member countries to impose such requirements. When other OECD Member countries require submission of partial or complete copies of the contract as a condition to granting consent to proposed movements, EPA will request the required information; absent submission of such information, some OECD Member countries may deny consent for the proposed movement.","Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materials Utilized for Precious Metal Recovery and universal waste management (batteries, pesticides, mercury-containing equipment and lamps)","1522(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 230310(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 230320(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2304(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2305(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2306(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2307(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 240130(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2620(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 2621(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 271091(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 271099(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 271390(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 300692(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 3825(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 4004(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 4017(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 411520(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 440139(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 440140(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 450190(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 4707(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7001(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7112(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720410(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720421(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720429(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720430(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720441(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 720449(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7404(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7503(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7602(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7802(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 7902(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 8002(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810197(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810297(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810330(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810420(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810530(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 8106(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810730(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810830(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 810930(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811020(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811213(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811222(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811252(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 811292(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 8113(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...), 854810(Only Hazardous waste, including recyclable Materi...)",Environmental Protection Agency,Title 40 - Protection of Environment; Part 262 - STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO GENERATORS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE - Subpart H—Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste for Recovery Within the OECD,"75 FR 1253, Jan. 8, 2010",08-01-2010,,,1078576#40 CFR 262,No objective specified,Environmental preservation
United States of America,World [Valid From: 05 Mar 1996],A82,Testing requirement,"(e) The method referred to in paragraph (c) of this section is as follows: Mix the contents of one or more containers and transfer 1/2 pound thereof to a 4-liter flask containing 2 liters of distilled water at room temperature (but not below 20 °C). Stopper the flask and swirl it moderately for 1/2 minute so that the rice is in motion and in uniform suspension. Allow the rice to settle for 1/2 minute, then pour off 1,600 milliliters of the water, together with any floating and suspended matter, and discard. To the contents of the flask, add 1,600 milliliters of distilled water and 20 milliliters of 10 N hydrochloric acid. Agitate vigorously and wash down the sides of the flask with 150 milliliters of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. In order to avoid excess foaming during the extraction, heat the mixture slowly to about 100 °C, agitate if necessary, and maintain at this temperature until air is expelled. Again wash down the sides of the flask with 150 milliliters of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. Heat the mixture in an autoclave at 120 °C to 123 °C for 30 minutes, remove and cool to room temperature. Dilute the mixture with distilled water so that the total volume is 2,500 milliliters. Swirl the flask, and while the solids are in uniform suspension pour off about 250 milliliters of the mixture for later determination of iron (and calcium, if this is to be determined). With filter paper that has been shown not to adsorb thiamine, riboflavin, or niacin, filter enough of the remaining mixture for determination of thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin. (In the case of a mixture difficult to filter, centrifuging or filtering through fritted glass, or both, using a suitable analytical filter-aid, may be substituted for, or may precede, filtering through paper.) Dilute an aliquot of filtrate with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, so that each milliliter contains about 0.2 microgram of thiamine, and determine thiamine by the “Rapid Fluorometric Method—Official Final Action,” in section 43.034 of “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists” (AOAC), 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference.

(1980), beginning with the third sentence of the second paragraph, “Adjust, with vigorous agitation * * *.” Determine niacin in a 200-milliliter aliquot of the filtrate by the “Colorimetric Method—Official Final Action,” in section 43.045, AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), beginning with the sixth sentence of the first paragraph, “Adjust to pH 4.5 with * * *.” Evaporate to dryness a 100-milliliter aliquot of the nonfiltered material withdrawn while agitating, and determine iron using the method “Iron—Official Final Action,” in sections 14.011, 14.012, and 14.013, AOAC, 13th Ed.

This section applies to catalogue and other printed material advertisements which provide a direct means of purchase or order of products requiring cautionary labeling under sections 24(a) and (b) of the FHSA.
 (b) Effective Date. Under the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, Public Law 110-314, 122 Stat. 3016 (August 14, 2008), (“CPSIA”), the effective date of the CPSIA's amendment to Section 24 of the FHSA to require cautionary statements in catalogues and other printed materials is February 10, 2009. By this rule, the Commission is providing a grace period of 180 days, or until August 9, 2009, during which catalogues and other printed materials printed prior to February 10, 2009, may be distributed without such cautionary statements. Catalogues and other printed materials that are printed on or after February 10, 2009, must have the required cautionary statements. All catalogues and other printed materials distributed on or after August 9, 2009, must comply with this rule. This rule addresses only catalogues and other printed materials; however, the CPSIA extends the requirements for cautionary statements to Internet advertisements as well. Internet advertisements must comply with Section 24 of the FHSA as amended by the CPSIA no later than December 12, 2008.
 
 (c) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply.
 (1) Ball means a spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal object that is designed or intended to be thrown, hit, kicked, rolled, dropped, or bounced. The term “ball” includes any spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal object that is attached to a toy or article by means of a string, elastic cord, or similar tether. The term “ball” also includes a multi-sided object formed by connecting planes into a generally spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal shape that is designated or intended to be used as a ball, and any novelty item of a generally spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal shape that is designated or intended to be used as a ball. The term “ball” does not include dice, or balls permanently enclosed inside pinball machines, mazes, or similar other containers. A ball is permanently enclosed if, when tested in accordance with 16 CFR 1500.53, it is not removed from the outer container.
 (2) Small ball means a ball that, under the influence of its own weight, passes in any orientation, entirely through a circular hole with a diameter of 1.75 inches (44.4 mm) in a rigid template 1/4 inches (6 mm) thick. In testing to evaluate compliance with this regulation, the diameter of opening in the Commission's test template shall be no greater than 1.75 inches (44.4 mm).
 (3) Latex balloon means a toy or decorative item consisting of a latex bag that is designed to be inflated by air or gas. The term does not include inflatable children's toys that are used in aquatic activities such as rafts, water wings, swim rings, or other similar items.
 (4) Marble means a ball made of hard material, such as glass, agate, marble, or plastic, that is used in various children's games, generally as a playing piece or marker. The term “marble” does not include a marble permanently enclosed in a toy or game. A marble is permanently enclosed if, when tested in accordance with 16 CFR 1500.53, it is not removed from the toy or game.
 (5) Small part means any object which, when tested in accordance with the procedures contained in 16 CFR 1501.4(a) and 1501.4(b)(1), fits entirely within the cylinder shown in Figure 1 appended to 16 CFR part 1501. The use and abuse testing provisions of 16 CFR 1500.51 through 1500.53 and 1501.4(b)(2) do not apply to this definition.
 (6) Direct means of purchase or order means any method of purchase that allows the purchaser to order the product without being in the physical presence of the product. Advertising that provides a direct means of purchase or order of a product would include catalogues or other printed advertising material that contain order blanks, telephone numbers or fax numbers for placing orders, and Internet Web sites that enable consumers to purchase a product online or through the use of a telephone number or fax number provided on the Internet Web site.
 (d) Advertising requirements. Any toy or game that requires a cautionary statement about the choking hazard associated with small parts, balloons, small balls, or marbles must bear that cautionary statement in the product's advertising if the advertising provides a direct means to purchase or order the product.
 (1) The advertising for any article that is a toy or game intended for use by children who are at least three years old but less than six years of age shall bear or contain the following cautionary statement if the toy or game includes a small part:

 [Please see PDF for image: ER17NO08.098] 
 
 
 (e) Abbreviated warnings for catalogues and other printed materials. Abbreviated versions of the required cautionary statements are permitted in each individual product advertisement, provided that the corresponding full cautionary statements appear in the catalogue and a statement referring to the precise location of the full cautionary statements—such as the page number on which the cautionary statements can be found—is located at the bottom of each catalogue page that contains one or more abbreviated cautionary statements. If abbreviated cautionary statements are used:
 (1) The full cautionary statements associated with the abbreviated cautionary statements shall appear:
 (i) Near the beginning of the catalogue, before any catalogue pages that contain advertisements of products available for purchase, or
 (ii) Adjacent to the ordering information or order form in the catalogue.
 (2) The full cautionary statements shall be in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout or color.
 (3) The full cautionary statements shall be clearly numbered according to the following scheme:

 (4) The abbreviated cautionary statements shall consist of items 1500.20(e)(3)(i) through 1500.20(e)(3)(iv):
 (i) A safety alert symbol substantially similar to that shown in figure 7.
 
 
 [Please see PDF for image: ER17NO08.099] 
 
 
 (ii) The phrase, “CHOKING HAZARD,” written in capital letters.

 (iii) Numbers, separated by commas and enclosed within a single set of parentheses, that identify the applicable cautionary statements for the product being advertised, followed by a period. These numbers shall match the numbers used to identify each full cautionary statement, as specified in 1500.20(e)(2).
 
 (iv) A single prohibited age range written as either “Not for under 3 yrs” or “Not for under 8 yrs,” based on the most restrictive age range for all required cautionary statements for that product. Thus, if an advertised product requires the cautionary statement specified in 16 CFR 1500.19(b)(2), the prohibited age range in the abbreviated cautionary statement shall be “Not for under 8 yrs.”
 (v) For example, see Figure 8 for the abbreviated cautionary statement for an advertisement of a product that requires the cautionary statements specified in 16 CFR 1500.19(b)(1) and 16 CFR 1500.19(b)(2).
 
 
 [Please see PDF for image: ER17NO08.100] 
 
 
 (f) Alternatives to cautionary statements for individual product advertisements in catalogues and other printed materials. Multiple identical full or abbreviated cautionary statements may be replaced with a single full cautionary statement under the following circumstances:
 (1) If all products available for purchase within a catalogue require the same cautionary statement, that cautionary statement, in full, may appear on the front cover, or equally conspicuous location, of the catalogue in lieu of repeating the cautionary statement within the catalogue, provided that it is communicated to consumers that the cautionary statement applies to all products in the catalogue.
 (2) If all products on one catalogue page or on two facing catalogue pages require the same cautionary statement, that cautionary statement, in full, may appear at the top of the page or pages in lieu of repeating the cautionary statement in each product advertisement, provided that it is communicated to consumers that the cautionary statement applies to all products on the catalogue page or pages.
 (g) Prominence and conspicuousness of labeling statements. The type size of abbreviated cautionary statements shall be reasonably related to the type size of any other printed matter in the product advertisement, and must be in conspicuous and legible type by typography, layout, or color with other printed matter in the advertisement and separated from other graphic matter.
 (h) Business to Business Catalogue Exception. The requirements of section 24(c)of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, as amended by section 105 of the CPSIA, do not apply to catalogues and other printed materials distributed solely between businesses unless the recipient business is one that could be expected to be purchasing the product for the use of children (instead of for resale, e.g.). Examples of businesses that can be expected to be purchasing products for the use of children include day care centers, schools, and churches.","Any toy or game associated with small parts, balloons, small balls, or marbles","9503(Only toys or games associated with small parts, b...), 950490(Only toys or games associated with small parts, b...), 9506(Only toys or games associated with small parts, b...)",Consumer Product Safety Commission,Title 16 - Commercial Practices; Part 1500 - HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND ARTICLES; ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT REGULATIONS - §1500.20 Labeling requirement for advertising toys and games,"73 FR 67736, Nov. 17, 2008, as amended at 73 FR 71545, Nov. 25, 2008",25-11-2008,,,1078533#16 CFR 1500,_ - No objective specified,No objective specified
United States of America,World [Valid From: 10 Dec 2012],B31,Labelling requirements,"§ 1500.121 Labeling requirements; prominence, placement, and conspicuousness
(a)(1) Background and scope. Section 2(p)(1) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) or “the Act”), 15 U.S.C. 1261(p)(1), requires that hazardous substances bear certain cautionary statements on their labels. These statements include: signal words; affirmative statements of the principal hazard(s) associated with a hazardous substance; the common or usual name, or chemical name, of the hazardous substance; the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller; statements of precautionary measures to follow; instructions, when appropriate, for special handling and storage; the statement “Keep Out of the Reach of Children” or its practical equivalent; and, when appropriate, first-aid instructions. Section 2(p)(2) of the Act specifies that all such statements shall be located prominently on the label of such a substance and shall appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout, or color with other printed matter on the label. This regulation contains the Commission's interpretations and policies for the type size and placement of cautionary material on the labels of hazardous substances and contains other criteria for such cautionary statements that are acceptable to the Commission as satisfying section 2(p)(2) of the Act. Labels that do not comply with this regulation may be considered misbranded.
 (2) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
 (i) Container means the immediate package from which a hazardous substance may be dispensed and also any article, package or wrapping, such as a tube or cone used for a firework or a wet cell battery casing containing sulfuric acid, which is necessary for the substance to function during actual use.
 (ii) Cautionary material, cautionary labeling, and cautionary labeling required by the Act mean all items of labeling information required by sections 2(p)(1) of the FHSA (repeated in 16 CFR 1500.3(b)(14)(i) or by the regulations which require additional labeling under section 3(b) of the Act.
 (iii) Display panel means any surface of the immediate container, and of any outer container or wrapping, which bears labeling.
 (iv) Principal display panel means the portion(s) of the surface of the immediate container, and of any outer container or wrapping, which bear(s) the labeling designed to be most prominently displayed, shown, presented, or examined under conditions of retail sale. (See paragraph (c)(1) of this section.)
 (v) Type size means the actual height of the printed image of each upper case or capital letter as it appears on the label of a hazardous substance. (See paragraph (c)(2) of this section.)
 (vi) Signal word means the appropriate word “DANGER,” “WARNING,” or “CAUTION,” as required by sections 2(p)(1) (C) or (D) of the Act.
 (vii) Statement of principal hazard(s) means that wording descriptive of the principal or primary hazard(s) associated with a hazardous substance required by section 2(p)(1)(E) of the Act. Some examples of such statements are “HARMFUL OR FATAL IF SWALLOWED,” “VAPOR HARMFUL,” “FLAMMABLE,” and “SKIN AND EYE IRRITANT.”
 (viii) Other cautionary material means all labeling statements, other than “signal words” or “statement(s) of principal hazard(s),” required by the Act or by regulations issued under the Act.
 (b) Prominent label placement. To satisfy the requirement of the Act that cautionary labeling statements shall appear “prominently” on the label of a hazardous substance, all such statements shall be placed on the label as follows:
 (1) Horizontal placement of labeling statements. Except for the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller, all cautionary material required by the Act shall appear in lines that are generally parallel to any base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed for sale or, on display panels other than the principal display panel, in lines generally parallel to all other labeling on that panel. This requirement does not apply to labeling on collapsible tubes, cylindrical containers with a narrow diameter, or F-type containers where both the “front” and “back” of the container are principal display panels. (See paragraph (e) of this section.)
 (2) Principal display panel labeling. (i) All items of cautionary labeling required by the Act may appear on the principal display panel on the immediate container and, if appropriate, on any other container or wrapper. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for requirements and exceptions for labeling outer containers and wrappings.
 (ii) The signal word, the statement of principal hazard(s), and, if appropriate, instructions to read carefully any cautionary material that may be placed elsewhere on the label shall be blocked together within a square or rectangular area, with or without a border, on the principal display panel on the immediate container and, where required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, on any outer container or wrapping. All cautionary statements placed on the principal display panel shall be separated on all sides from other printed or graphic matter, with the exception of the declaration of net contents required under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C. 1453(a) (2) and (3), by a border line or by a space no smaller than the minimum allowable height of the type size for cautionary material required by the Act (exclusive of signal words and statements of hazard) on the principal display panel.
 (iii) Depending on the design of the package or the configuration of the label, or both, a package may have more than one principal display panel. If so, each principal display panel must bear, at a minimum, the signal word, statement of principal hazard or hazards, and, if appropriate, instructions to read carefully any cautionary material that may be placed elsewhere on the label.
 (A) Where the principal display panel of the immediate container consists of a lid, cap, or other item which may be separated from the immediate container and discarded, the container shall be deemed to have a second principal display panel elsewhere on the immediate container which must bear, at a minimum, the signal word, statement of principal hazard(s), and instructions, if appropriate, to read any cautionary material which may be placed elsewhere on the label.
 (3) Prominent label placement—other display panel labeling. All items of cautionary labeling required by the Act which do not appear on the principal display panel shall be placed together on a display panel elsewhere on the container. The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller may appear separately on any display panel. Where cautionary material appears on a display panel other than the principal display panel, the principal display panel shall bear the statement “Read carefully other cautions on the ___ panel,” or its practical equivalent. [A description of the location of the other panel is to be inserted in the blank space.]
 (4) Outer container or wrappings. All cautionary labeling appearing on the immediate container of a hazardous substance shall also appear on any outer container or wrapping used in the retail display of the substance, in the same manner as required for the immediate container. Those cautionary labeling statements appearing on the immediate container which are clearly legible through any outer container or wrapper used in retail display need not appear on the outer container or wrapping itself. (See section 2(n)(1) of the Act.)
 (5) Placement of the word “Poison” and the skull and crossbones symbol. The word “poison” and, when appropriate, the skull and crossbones symbol shall appear on the label of a hazardous substance as follows:

 (i) If a hazardous substance is “highly toxic,” as defined in § 1500.3(c)(i) and section 2(h)(1) of the FHSA, the label must bear the word “poison” in accordance with section 2(p)(1)(H) of the Act, in addition to the signal word “DANGER,” and must also bear the skull and crossbones symbol. Some products, under § 1500.14(b) of the regulations, may, in addition to any required signal word, be required to bear the word “poison” and the skull and crossbones symbol because of the special hazard associated with their ingredients. In both instances, the word “poison” and the skull and crossbones symbol need not appear on the principal display panel on the container, unless all other cautionary labeling required by the Act appears on the principal display panel. The word “poison” and the skull and crossbones symbol, when required, must appear either together with other cautionary labeling on a display panel other than the principal display panel or together with the signal word and statement(s) of principal hazard on the principal display panel.
 (ii) Where, pursuant to a regulation issued under section 3(b) of the Act, the label of a hazardous substance requires the word “poison” instead of a signal word, the word, “POISON” shall appear in capital letters on the principal display panel, together with the statement(s) of the principal hazard. Certain substances for which the word “poison” is required instead of any signal word are listed in § 1500.129.
 (c) Conspicuousness—type size and style. To satisfy the requirement that cautionary labeling statements under the Act be conspicuous and legible, such statements shall conform to the following requirements:
 (1) Area of principal display panel. The area of the principal display panel is the area of the side or surface of the immediate container, or of the side or surface of any outer container or wrapping, that bears the labeling designed to be most prominently displayed, shown, presented, or examined under conditions of retail sale. This area is not limited to the portion of the surface covered with labeling; rather, it includes the entire surface. Flanges at the tops and bottoms of cans, conical shoulders of cans, handles, and shoulders and necks of bottles and jars are excluded in measuring the area. For the purposes of determining the proper type size for cautionary labeling, the area of the principal display panel (or other panel bearing cautionary labeling, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) is to be computed as follows:
 (i) In the case of a rectangular package, where one entire side is the principal display panel, the product of the height times the width of that side shall be the area of the principal display panel.
 (ii) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container or tube on which the principal display panel appears on the side, the area of the principal display panel shall be 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times its circumference.
 (iii) In the case of any other shape of container, the area of the principal display panel shall be 40 percent of the total surface of the container, excluding those areas, such as flanges at tops and bottoms, specified in paragraph (c)(1) above. However, if such a container presents an obvious principal display panel (such as an oval or hour-glass shaped area on the side of a container for dishwashing detergent), the area to be measured shall be the entire area of the obvious principal display panel.
 (2) Type-size requirements. (i) The term type size refers to the height of the actual printed image of each upper case or capital letter as it appears on the label. The size of cautionary labeling shall be reasonably related to the type size of any other printing appearing on the same panel, but in any case must meet the minimum size requirements in table 1.

 (ii) When an item of labeling is required to be in a specified type size, all upper case, or capital, letters must be at least equal in height to the required type size, and all other letters must be the same style as the upper case or capital letters. Unless otherwise specified in the regulations (examples appear at §§ 1500.14(b)(6), 1512.19, 1508.9, and part 1505), the type size of all cautionary statements appearing on any display panel shall comply with the specifications in table 1 when the area of the display panel is measured by the method in paragraph (c)(1) above:

[...]

(iii) If all of the required cautionary labeling does not appear on the principal display panel, the statement to “Read carefully other cautions on the ___ panel,” or its practical equivalent, must appear in, as a minimum, the same type size as that required in table 1 for the other cautionary material which appears elsewhere on the label of a hazardous substance. The size of the cautionary labeling that does not appear on the principal display panel is determined by the area of the panel on which it does appear.
 (3) Type style—proportion. The ratio of the height of a capital or uppercase letter to its width shall be such that the height of the letter is no more than 3 times its width.
 (4) Signal word and statements of hazard—capital letters. The signal word, the word “poison” if required instead of a signal word (see § 1500.129), and the statement of principal hazard or hazards shall be in capital letters.
 (5) Multiple statement of hazard—type size and style. All statements of principal hazard or hazards on a label shall appear in the same size and style of type, and shall appear in the same color or have the same degree of boldness.
 (6) Accompanying literature containing directions for use. Where literature accompanying the package of a hazardous substance has directions for use, written or otherwise, section 2(n) of the Act requires the literature to bear cautionary labeling.
 (i) All such cautionary labeling shall be in reasonable proximity to any direction for use and shall be placed together within the same general area.
 (ii) The type size of such cautionary labeling shall be reasonably related to the type size of any other printed matter in the accompanying literature and must be in conspicuous and legible type by typography, layout, or color with other printed matter on the label. The signal word and statement of principal hazard or hazards shall appear in capital letters.
 (d) Conspicuousness—contrast. To satisfy the requirement that cautionary labeling statements appear in conspicuous and legible type which is in contrast by typography, layout, or color with the other printed matter on the label, such statements shall conform to the following requirements:
 (1) Color. Where color is the primary method used to achieve appropriate contrast, the color of any cautionary labeling statement shall be in sharp contrast with the color of the background upon which such a statement appears. Examples of combinations of colors which may not satisfy the requirement for sharp contrast are: black letters on a dark blue or dark green background, dark red letters on a light red background, light red letters on a reflective silver background, and white letters on a light gray or tan background.
 (2) Interference with conspicuousness—labeling design, vignettes, or other printed material. For cautionary information appearing on panels other than the principal display panel, the label design, the use of vignettes, or the proximity of other labeling or lettering shall not be such that any cautionary labeling statement is obscured or rendered inconspicuous.
 (e) Collapsible metal tubes. Collapsible metal tubes containing hazardous substances shall be labeled so that all cautionary labeling required by the Act appears as close to the dispensing end of the container as possible. The placement and conspicuousness of these statements shall conform to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
 
 (f) Unpackaged hazardous substances. Where practicable, unpackaged hazardous substances intended, or distributed in a form suitable, for use in or around a household or by children shall be labeled so that all items of information required by the Act appear upon the article itself. In instances where this is impracticable (for example, because of the size or nature of the article), the required cautionary labeling must be displayed by means of a tag or other suitable material that is no less than five square inches in area and is securely affixed to the article so that the labeling will remain attached throughout conditions of merchandising and distribution to the ultimate consumer. The placement and conspicuousness of all cautionary labeling appearing on such a tag or material, or on an unpackaged article, shall conform to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. For the purposes of determining the proper type size to use on a tag or other material, the area of one side of the tag or other material shall be the area of the principal display panel.
 (g) Exemptions. All requirements of the Act are satisfied by compliance with this § 1500.121. However, exemptions can be granted under section 3(c) of the Act and § 1500.83, or under the provisions of another statute should this section be incorporated in regulations under another statute. Section 1500.82 contains the requirements for exemption requests under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act.
 (h) Effective date. The provisions of this rule apply to hazardous substances bearing labels printed after December 30, 1985. Labels printed prior to the effective date of this rule may be applied until not later than December 28, 1987. This rule applies to all hazardous substances to which labels are applied after December 28, 1987.

§ 1500.127 Substances with multiple hazards
 (a) Any article that presents more than one type of hazard (for example, if the article is both toxic and flammable) must be labeled with: An affirmative statement of each such hazard; the precautionary measures describing the action to be followed or avoided for each such hazard; instructions, when necessary or appropriate, for first-aid treatment of persons suffering from the ill effects that may result from each such hazard; instructions for handling and storage of articles that require special care in handling and storage because of more than one type of hazard presented by the article; and the common or usual name (or the chemical name if there is no common or usual name) for each hazardous component present in the article.
 (b) Label information referring to the possibility of one hazard may be combined with parallel information concerning any additional hazards presented by the article if the resulting condensed statement contains all of the information needed for dealing with each type of hazard presented by the article.

§1500.133 Extremely flammable contact adhesives; labeling
(a) Extremely flammable contact adhesives, also known as contact bonding cements, when distributed in containers intended or suitable for household use may be misbranded under the act if the containers fail to bear a warning statement adequate for the protection of the public health and safety.
 (b) The following warning statement is considered as the minimum cautionary labeling adequate to meet the requirements of section 2(p)(1) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)(i)) with respect to containers of more than one-half pint of contact adhesive and similar liquid or semiliquid articles having a flashpoint at or below 20 °F. as determined by the method in § 1500.43, when the only hazard foreseeable is that caused by the extreme flammability of the mixture:
 
 Danger
 Extremely Flammable
 Vapors May Cause Flash Fire
 Vapors may ignite explosively.
 Prevent buildup of vapors—open all windows and doors—use only with cross-ventilation.
 Keep away from heat, sparks, and open flame.
 Do not smoke, extinguish all flames and pilot lights, and turn off stoves, heaters, electric motors, and other sources of ignition during use and until all vapors are gone.
 Close container after use.
 Keep out of the reach of children.
 

 (c) The words that are in capital letters in the warning statement set forth in paragraph (b) of this section should be printed on the main (front) panel or panels of the container in capital letters of the type size specified in § 1500.121(c). The balance of the cautionary information may appear together on another panel provided the front panel bears a statement such as “Read carefully other cautions on ___ panel,” the blank being filled in with the identification of the specific label panel bearing the balance of the cautionary labeling. It is recommended that a borderline be used in conjunction with the cautionary labeling.
 (d) If an article has additional hazards, or contains ingredients listed in § 1500.14 as requiring special labeling, appropriate additional front and rear panel precautionary labeling is required.
 (e) Since the Commission has issued a regulation banning under the Consumer Product Safety Act extremely flammable contact adhesives covered by this labeling regulation (sec. 16 CFR part 1302), paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section are revoked as to the subject products after June 13, 1978.",Hazardous substances,"9503(Only toys or other articles intended for use by c...), 950490(Only toys or other articles intended for use by c...), 9506(Only toys or other articles intended for use by c...), 950890(Only toys or other articles intended for use by c...)",Consumer Product Safety Commission,Title 16 - Commercial Practices; Part 1500 - HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND ARTICLES; ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT REGULATIONS - PART 1500—HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND ARTICLES; ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT REGULATIONS,"[74 FR 43041, Aug. 26, 2009, as amended at 80 FR 61732, Oct. 14, 2015]",10-12-2012,,,1078533#16 CFR 1500,A - Protection of human life and health,The protection of public health and safety

 § 800.18
 Waivers of the official inspection and Class X weighing requirements.
 (a) General. Waivers from the official inspection and Class X weighing requirements for export grain under section 5 of the Act shall be provided in accordance with this section and the Act.
 (b) Waivers. (1) 15,000 metric-ton waiver. Official inspection and Class X weighing requirements apply only to exporters and individual elevator operators who (i) exported 15,000 metric tons or more of grain during the preceding calendar year, or (ii) have exported 15,000 metric tons or more of grain during the current calendar year. Exporters and elevator operators who are granted a waiver by reason of this paragraph shall, as a condition of the waiver, keep such accounts, records, and memorandum to fully and correctly disclose all transactions concerning lots of all export grain shipments. In addition, the exporters or elevator operators shall notify the Service in writing of the intention to export grain under this waiver. In the case of lots waived under this provision, if such lots are required by contract to be inspected or weighed, or if the lots are represented by official inspection or weight certificates, then such certificates shall meet the requirements of section 5 of the Act.
 (2) Grain exported for seeding purposes. Official inspection and Class X weighing requirements do not apply to grain exported for seeding purposes, provided that (i) the grain is (A) sold or consigned for sale and invoiced as seed; and (B) identified as seed for seeding purposes on the Shipper's Export Declaration; and (ii) records pertaining to these shipments are made available, upon request by the Service, for review or copying purposes.
 (3) Grain shipped in bond. Official inspection and weighing requirements do not apply to grain that is shipped from a foreign country to a foreign country through the United States in bond in accordance with applicable regulations of the United States Customs Service (19 CFR part 18).
 (4) Grain exported by rail or truck to Canada or Mexico. Inspection and weighing requirements do not apply to grain exported by rail or truck from the United States to Canada or Mexico.
 (5) Grain not sold by grade. Official inspection requirements may be waived by the Service on a shipment-by-shipment basis for export grain not sold, offered for sale, or consigned for sale by official grade if (i) the contract and any amendments clearly show that the buyer and seller mutually agree to ship the grain without official inspection and (ii) a copy of the contract and any amendments is furnished in advance of loading, along with a completed application on a form prescribed by the Service.
 (6) Service not available. Upon request, any required official inspection or Class X weighing of grain may be waived on a shipment-by-shipment basis if (i) official personnel are not and will not be available within a 24-hour period to perform needed inspection or weighing services and (ii) both the buyer and seller of the grain are made aware that the grain has not been officially inspected or Class X weighed.
 (7) Emergency waiver. Upon request, the requirements for official inspection or Class X weighing may be waived whenever the Service determines (i) that an emergency exists that precludes official inspection or Class X weighing and (ii) that granting an emergency waiver will not impair the objectives of the Act. To qualify for an emergency waiver, the exporter or elevator operator shall make timely application and comply with all conditions which may be required by the Service.

(b) The tolerance applicable to the prohibition of the noxious weed seeds listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be two seeds in the minimum amount required to be examined as shown in column 1 of table 1 of § 361.5. If fewer than two seeds are found in an initial examination, the shipment from which the sample was drawn may be entered. If two seeds are found in an initial examination, a second sample must be examined. If two or fewer seeds are found in the second examination, the shipment from which the samples were drawn may be entered. If three or more seeds are found in the second examination, the shipment from which the samples were drawn may not be entered. If three or more seeds are found in an initial examination, the shipment from which the sample was drawn may not be entered.
 (c) Any seed of any noxious weed that can be determined by visual inspection (including the use of transmitted light or dissection) to be within one of the following categories shall be considered inert matter and not counted as a weed seed:
 (1) Damaged seed (other than grasses) with over one half of the embryo missing;
 (2) Grass florets and caryopses classed as inert:
 (i) Glumes and empty florets of weedy grasses;
 (ii) Damaged caryopses, including free caryopses, with over one-half the root-shoot axis missing (the scutellum excluded);
 (iii) Immature free caryopses devoid of embryo or endosperm;
 (iv) Free caryopses of quackgrass (Elytrigia repens) that are 2 mm or less in length; or
 (v) Immature florets of quackgrass (Elytrigia repens) in which the caryopses are less than one-third the length of the palea. The caryopsis is measured from the base of the rachilla.
 (3) Seeds of legumes (Fabaceae) with the seed coats entirely removed.

 (4) Immature seed units, devoid of both embryo and endosperm, such as occur in (but not limited to) the following plant families: buckwheat (Polygonaceae), morning glory (Convolvulaceae), nightshade (Solanaceae), and sunflower (Asteraceae).
 (5) Dodder (Cuscuta spp.) seeds devoid of embryos and seeds that are ashy gray to creamy white in color are inert matter. Dodder seeds should be sectioned when necessary to determine if an embryo is present, as when the seeds have a normal color but are slightly swollen, dimpled, or have minute holes.

§ 361.8
 Cleaning of imported seed and processing of certain Canadian-origin screenings.
 (a) Imported seed that is found to contain noxious weed seeds at a level higher than the tolerances set forth in § 361.6(b) may be cleaned under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector. The cleaning will be at the expense of the owner or consignee.
 (1) At the location where the seed is being cleaned, the identity of the seed must be maintained at all times to the satisfaction of the Administrator. The refuse from the cleaning must be placed in containers and securely sealed and identified. Upon completion of the cleaning, a representative sample of the seed will be analyzed by a registered seed technologist, an official seed laboratory, or by APHIS; if the seed is found to be within the noxious weed tolerances set forth in § 361.6(b), the seed may be allowed entry into the United States;
 (2) The refuse from the cleaning must be destroyed under the monitoring of an APHIS inspector at the expense of the owner or consignee of the seed.
 (3) Any person engaged in the business of cleaning imported seed may enter into a compliance agreement under paragraph (c) of this section to facilitate the cleaning of seed imported into the United States under this part.
 (b) Any person engaged in the business of processing screenings who wishes to process screenings imported from Canada under § 361.7(c) that are otherwise prohibited under this part must enter into a compliance agreement under paragraph (c) of this section.
 (c) A compliance agreement for the cleaning of imported seed or processing of otherwise prohibited screenings from Canada shall be a written agreement 1

 between a person engaged in such a business, the State in which the business operates, and APHIS, wherein the person agrees to comply with the provisions of this part and any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. Any compliance agreement may be canceled orally or in writing by the APHIS inspector who is monitoring its enforcement whenever the inspector finds that the person who entered into the compliance agreement has failed to comply with the provisions of this part or any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. If the cancellation is oral, the decision and the reasons for the decision shall be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit. Any person whose compliance agreement has been canceled may appeal the decision to the Administrator, in writing, within 10 days after receiving written notification of the cancellation. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the compliance agreement was wrongfully canceled. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.","Agricultural seed, vegetable seed, and screenings","100111, 100191, 100210, 100310, 100410, 1005, 100610, 100710, 100810(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 100821, 100830(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 100860(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 100890(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120110(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120230(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 1204(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 1205, 1206(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120721, 120730(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120740(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120750(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120760(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120799(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120921(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120922(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120923(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120924(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120925(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120929(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120930(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120991(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 120999(Only agricultural seed and vegetable seeds from t...), 121130(Only screenings, chaff, sterile florets, immature...), 121140(Only screenings, chaff, sterile florets, immature...), 121190(Only screenings, chaff, sterile florets, immature...), 140490(Only screenings, chaff, sterile florets, immature...)","Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA","Title 7 - Agriculture.

 (ii) Any toy or game intended for children who are at least three years old but less than eight years of age that contains a marble shall bear the following cautionary statement:
 
 
 [Please see PDF for image: ER27FE95.006] 
 
 
 (c) Age of intended user. In determining the ages of the children for which any toy or article subject to this section is intended, the following factors are relevant: the manufacturer's stated intent (such as the age stated on a label) if it is reasonable; the advertising, marketing, and promotion of the article; and whether the article is commonly recognized as being intended for children in this age group. In enforcing this provision, the Commission will follow the procedures set forth in 16 CFR 1501.5.

 (d) Prominence and conspicuousness of labeling statements. The requirements of 16 CFR 1500.121 relating to the prominence and conspicuousness of precautionary labeling statements for hazardous substances shall apply to any labeling statement required under § 1500.19(b) and (f), with the following clarifications and modifications.
 (1) All labeling statements required by § 1500.19(b) and (f) shall be in the English language. The statements required by paragraph (b) need not appear in the format and layout depicted in paragraph (b). The statements required by 16 CFR 1500.19(b) and (f) shall be blocked together within a square or rectangular area, with or without a border. This means that the statements must appear on at least two lines. The statements shall be separated from all other graphic material by a space no smaller than the minimum allowable height of the type size for other cautionary material (e.g., the phrase “Not for children under 3 yrs.”). If not separated by that distance, the labeling statements must be surrounded by a border line. Label design, the use of vignettes, or the proximity of other labeling or lettering shall not obscure or render inconspicuous any labeling statement required under § 1500.19(b) and (f). This means that such statements shall appear on a solid background, which need not differ from the background color or any other color on the package label.
 (2) The words “WARNING” or “SAFETY WARNING” required by section 24 of the FHSA shall be regarded as signal words.
 (3) The statement “CHOKING HAZARD” shall be regarded as a statement of the principal hazard associated with the products subject to this section.
 (4) All other remaining statements required by this section shall be regarded as “other cautionary material” as that term is defined in 16 CFR 1500.121(a)(2)(viii).
 (5) The principal display panel for a bin, container for retail display, or vending machine shall be the side or surface designed to be most prominently displayed, shown, or presented to, or examined by, prospective purchasers. In the case of bins or containers for retail display, the cautionary material may be placed on a display card of a reasonable size in relationship to the surface area of the bin or container. The area of the display card shall constitute the area of the principal display panel. In the case of vending machines that contain a display card, the cautionary label may be placed either on the display card, on the coinage indicator decal, or on the glass or clear plastic of the machine. If there is no display card inside a vending machine, the size of the principal display panel will be calculated in accordance with 16 CFR 1500.121(c) based on the size of the front of the container from which items are dispensed, exclusive of the area of metal attachments, coin inserts, bases, etc. Any other side or surface of such a bin, container for retail sale, or vending machine that bears information, such as price or product description, for examination by purchasers shall be deemed to be a principal display panel, excluding any side or surface with information that only identifies the company that owns or operates a vending machine.
 (6) All of the labeling statements required by this section, including those classified as “other cautionary material,” must appear on the principal display panel of the product, except as provided for by § 1500.19(f). Any signal word shall appear on the same line and in close proximity to the triangle required by section 24 of the act. Multiple messages should be provided with sufficient space between them, when feasible, to prevent them from visually blending together.

 (7) All labeling statements required by this section shall comply with the following type size requirements. 16 CFR 1500.121(c)(1) explains how to compute the area of the principal display panel and letter height.

 (8) Labeling required by this section that appears on a bin, container for retail display, or vending machine shall be in reasonable proximity to any pricing or product information contained on the principal display panel, or, if such information is not present, in close proximity to the article that is subject to the labeling requirements.
 (9) Descriptive material that accompanies a product subject to the labeling requirements, including accompanying material subject to the alternative allowed by § 1500.19(f), shall comply with the requirements of 16 CFR 1500.121(c)(6) relating to literature containing instructions for use which accompanies a hazardous substance. If the descriptive material contains instructions for use, the required precautionary labeling shall be in reasonable proximity to such instructions or directions and shall be placed together within the same general area (see 16 CFR 1500.121(c)(6)).
 (10) In the case of any alternative labeling statement permitted under § 1500.19(e), the requirements of 16 CFR 1500.121(b)(3) and 1500.121(c)(2)(iii) shall apply to statements or indicators on the principal display panel directing attention to the complete cautionary labeling that appears on another display panel.
 (11) Any triangle required by this section shall be an equilateral triangle. The height of such a triangle shall be equal to or exceed the height of the letters of the signal word “WARNING”. The height of the exclamation point inside the triangle shall be at least half the height of the triangle, and the exclamation point shall be centered vertically in the triangle. The triangle shall be separated from the signal word by a distance at least equal to the space occupied by the first letter of the signal word. In all other respects, triangles with exclamation points shall conform generally to the provisions of 16 CFR 1500.121 relating to signal words.

 (e) Combination of labeling statements. The labels of products that contain more than one item subject to the requirements of this section may combine information relating to each of the respective hazards, if the resulting condensed statement contains all of the information necessary to describe the hazard presented by each article. However, in the case of a product that contains a balloon and another item subject to the labeling requirements, only the signal word and statement of hazard may be combined.

 (f) Alternative labeling statements for small packages. Any cautionary statement required by section 1500.19(b) may be displayed on a display panel of the package of a product subject to the labeling requirement other than the principal display panel only if:
 (1) The package has a principal display panel of 15 square inches or less,
 (2) The full labeling statement required by paragraph (b) of this section is displayed in three or more languages on another display panel of the package of the product, and
 (3)(i) In the case of a toy or game subject to § 1500.19(b)(1), a small ball subject to § 1500.19(b)(3), a marble subject to § 1500.19(b)(4), or a toy or game containing such a ball or marble, the principal display panel of the package bears the statement:
 
 
 [Please see PDF for image: ER27FE95.007] 
 
 
 
 and bears an arrow or other indicator pointing toward or directing the purchaser's attention to the display panel on the package where the full labeling statement appears, or
 (ii) In the case of a balloon subject to § 1500.19(b)(2) or a toy or game containing such a balloon, the principal display panel bears the statement:
 
 
 [Please see PDF for image: ER27FE95.008] 
 
 
 and bears an arrow or other indicator pointing toward or directing the purchaser's attention to the display panel on the package where the full labeling statement appears.

 (g) Alternative for products manufactured outside the United States. In the case of a product subject to the labeling requirements of § 1500.19(b) which is manufactured outside the United States and is shipped directly from the manufacturer to the consumer by United States mail or other delivery service in an immediate package that contains descriptive material, the descriptive material inside the immediate package of the product need not bear the required labeling statement only if the shipping container of the product contains other accompanying material that bears the required statements displayed in a prominent and conspicuous manner. Products shipped from abroad to a U.S. affiliate for shipment to consumers are included within the scope of this exception.

 (h) Preemption. Section 101(e) of the Child Safety Protection Act of 1994 prohibits any state or political subdivision of a state from enacting or enforcing any requirement relating to cautionary labeling addressing small parts hazards or choking hazards associated with any toy, game, marble, small ball, or balloon intended or suitable for use by children unless the state or local requirement is identical to a requirement established by section 24 of the FHSA or by 16 CFR 1500.19. Section 101(e) allows a state or political subdivision of a state to enforce a non-identical requirement relating to cautionary labeling warning of small parts hazards or choking hazards associated with any toy subject to the provisions of section 24 of FHSA until January 1, 1995, if the non-identical requirement was in effect on October 2, 1993.","Toys and other articles intended for use by children

United States of America,World [Valid From: 01 Nov 1994],B83,Certification requirement,"§ 80.161 Detergent additive certification program.
 (a) Effective dates and applicability of requirements. (1) As of July 1, 1997:
 (i) Detergent additives for the control of port fuel injector deposits (PFID) and/or intake valve deposits (IVD) in gasoline engines may not be transferred or sold for use in compliance with this subpart unless such additives have been certified according to the requirements of this section.
 (ii) Except as provided in § 80.169(c)(8), PFID and IVD control additives may not be added to gasoline or post-refinery component (PRC) for compliance with this subpart unless such additives have been certified according to the requirements of this section.
 (iii) Gasoline may not be sold or transferred to a party who sells or transfers gasoline to the ultimate consumer unless such gasoline contains detergent additives which have been certified according to the requirements of this section.
 (2) Beginning August 1, 1997, all gasoline sold or transferred to the ultimate consumer must contain detergent additive(s) which have been certified, according to the requirements of this section, to be effective for the control of PFID and IVD in gasoline engines.
 (3) Except as specifically exempted in § 80.173, these detergency requirements apply to all gasoline, whether intended for on-highway or nonroad use, including conventional, oxygenated, reformulated, and leaded gasolines, as well as the gasoline component in mixtures of petroleum and alcohol fuels, gasoline used as marine fuel, gasoline service accumulation fuel (as described in § 86.113-94(a)(1) of this chapter), the gasoline component of fuel mixtures of petroleum and methanol used for service accumulation in flexible fuel vehicles (as described in § 86.113-94(d) of this chapter), the gasoline used for factory fill purposes, and all additized PRC.
 (4) The specific controls and prohibitions applicable to persons subject to these regulations are set forth in § 80.168.
 (b) Detergent additive certification requirements. For a detergent additive package to be certified as eligible for use by detergent blenders in complying with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, the requirements listed in this paragraph (b) must be satisfied for such detergent. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, if the certifier fails to conduct the specified tests or to submit the specified materials, or if EPA judges the testing or materials to be inadequate, or if the detergent fails EPA confirmatory deposit control performance testing pursuant to § 80.167, the Administrator may deny or withdraw the detergent's eligibility to be used to satisfy the detergency requirements of this subpart.
 (1) The detergent additive manufacturer must properly register the detergent additive under 40 CFR part 79. For this purpose:
 (i) The compositional data required under § 79.21(a) of this chapter shall include the information specified in § 80.162.
 (ii) The minimum recommended additive concentration required under § 79.21(d) of this chapter shall be reported to EPA in units of gallons of detergent additive package per 1000 gallons of gasoline or PRC, provided to four digits. This concentration is the lowest additive concentration (LAC) referred to in § 80.170, and shall be reported as follows:
 (A) For a detergent additive registered for use in unleaded gasoline, the minimum concentration must be determined and reported for each certification option under which the manufacturer wishes to certify the additive pursuant to § 80.163.
 (1) In the case of a detergent certified for use in California gasoline based on an existing certification granted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), pursuant to § 80.163(d), the minimum recommended concentration must equal or exceed the amount specified in the CARB certification.
 (2) In the case of the alternative national generic certification option pursuant to § 80.163(a)(1)(iii), the minimum recommended concentration must equal or exceed the amount mixed into the associated test fuel specified in § 80.177, which was shown to satisfy the fuel injector deposit control and intake valve deposit control performance tests and standards specified in § 80.176.
 (3) In the case of any other detergent certification option, the minimum recommended concentration must equal or exceed the amount mixed into the associated test fuel specified in § 80.164, which was shown to satisfy the fuel injector deposit control and intake valve deposit control performance tests and standards specified in § 80.165.
 (B) For a detergent registered for use in leaded gasoline, the minimum recommended concentration must be no less than the amount shown to be needed for control of carburetor deposits, pursuant to the test procedure and test fuel guidelines in § 80.166.
 (C) Once it has been registered by EPA, the minimum recommended concentration specified by a detergent manufacturer to detergent blenders and other users of the additive, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, may not be changed without first notifying EPA. Such notification should be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b). The change in minimum concentration must be supported by existing certification data or else the notification to EPA must be accompanied by new certification information which demonstrates that the modification is consistent with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section.
 (D) A manufacturer may use a single set of certification test data to demonstrate the deposit control effectiveness of more than one registered detergent additive product, provided that:
 (1) The additive products contain all of the same detergent-active components and no detergent-active components other than those contained in common; and
 (2) The minimum concentration recommended for the use of each such additive product is specified such that, when each additive product is mixed in gasoline at the recommended concentration, each of its detergent-active components will be present at a final concentration no less than the lowest concentration of that component which was present when the tested additive product met the PFID and IVD performance standards specified in § 80.165.

 (2) The detergent additive manufacturer (or other certifying party) must submit to EPA a sample of the actual detergent additive package which was used in the certification test fuels specified in § 80.164 or § 80.177 or, if such sample is not available, then a sample which has the same composition as the package used in certification testing.
 (i) The sample volume shall be between 250 ml and 500 ml.
 (ii) The sample shall be packaged in a container which has a resealable closure and which will maintain sample integrity for at least one year. The container shall be labeled with the name and address of the manufacturer and the name of the detergent additive package.
 (iii) Any known shelf life limitations, and any available information on optimal temperature, light exposure, or other conditions to prolong sample shelf life, shall be provided.
 (iv) If the certifying party wishes to claim that the sample or any accompanying documents are entitled to special handling for reasons of business confidentiality, the party must clearly identify the sample or documents as such. EPA will handle any samples or documents with such claims according to the regulations at 40 CFR part 2.
 (v) The sample shall be submitted to EPA, at the address provided in § 80.174(a), within seven days of the date on which the certification letter for the detergent package is sent to EPA as required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
 (3) The detergent additive manufacturer (or other certifying party) shall submit a certification letter for the detergent additive package to the address in § 80.174(b). The party must use certified or express mail with return receipt service. The letter shall be signed by a person legally authorized to represent the certifying party and shall contain the following information:
 (i) Identifying information.
 (A) The name and address of the detergent additive manufacturer.
 (B) In any case where the certifier is not the detergent additive manufacturer, such as in the case of a fuel-specific certification pursuant to § 80.163(c), the name and address of the certifier.
 (C) The commercial identifying name of the detergent additive product as registered under the requirements of § 79.21 of this chapter.
 (ii) A statement attesting that:
 (A) The detergent package which is the subject of this certification has been tested according to applicable procedural and test fuel requirements in this subpart and has met the applicable performance standards; and
 (B) The testing was conducted in a manner consistent with good engineering practices; and
 (C) Complete documentation of the test fuel formulation, IVD demonstration procedures, fuel injector deposit demonstration procedure if applicable, detergent performance test procedures, and test results are available for EPA's inspection upon request.
 (iii) The name and location of the laboratory(ies) at which the certification testing was conducted and the dates during which the testing was conducted.
 (iv) For each option under which certification is sought pursuant to § 80.163, specifications of the test fuel(s) in which the detergent underwent performance testing. These fuel specifications must include:
 (A) The sulfur content in weight percent.
 (B) The T-90 distillation point in degrees Fahrenheit.
 (C) The olefin content in volume percent.
 (D) The aromatic content in volume percent.
 (E) The identity and volume percent of any oxygenate compound.
 (F) The source of the test fuel(s) and/or fuel blend stocks used to formulate the test fuel(s).
 (v) In the case of a national or PADD certification (pursuant to § 80.163(a)(1) or (b)) for which the test fuel was specially formulated from refinery blend stocks, the results of the IVD demonstration test, pursuant to § 80.164(b)(3). In the case of an alternative national generic certification (pursuant to § 80.163(a)(1)(iii)), the results of the IVD demonstration test and fuel injector deposit demonstration test (pursuant to § 80.177).

 (vi) In the case of a fuel-specific detergent certification, pursuant to § 80.163(c), the definition of the segregated gasoline pool, including any permitted PRC, for which the certification is sought, and the fuel parameter percentile distributions determined for the subject gasoline pool, as specified in § 80.164(c). The percentile distributions must include all of the fuel parameters listed in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) (A) through (D) of this section, along with any other fuel parameter(s) which the certifier wishes to use to define the certification fuel. As specified in § 80.164(c)(1)(iv), the procedures used to measure the additional parameters must be identified, as well as the levels of these additional parameters present in the test fuel(s).
 (vii) In the case of a certification for California gasoline based on an existing certification granted by CARB, pursuant to § 80.163(d), a copy of the CARB certificate.
 (viii) The test concentration(s) of the subject detergent additive in each test fuel, and the corresponding test results (percent flow restriction demonstrated in the fuel injector test and milligrams of deposit per valve demonstrated in the IVD test).
 (ix) For each option under which certification of the detergent is sought, the minimum recommended concentration which the certifying party seeks to establish for the detergent additive package, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
 (4) EPA will acknowledge receipt of the detergent certification letter. The effective date of certification will be the sooner of 60 days from the date on which EPA receives the certification letter, or the certifier's receipt of EPA's acknowledgement of the certification letter. However, neither the passage of 60 days nor EPA's acknowledgement will signify acceptance by EPA of the validity of the information in the certification letter or the adequacy or potency of the detergent sample submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. EPA may elect at any time to review the detergent certification data, analyze the submitted detergent additive sample, or subject the detergent additive package to confirmatory testing as described in § 80.167 and, where appropriate, may disqualify a detergent certification according to the provisions in paragraph (e) of this section.
 (c) The minimum concentration reported in the detergent registration according to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, plus any restrictions in use associated with that concentration, must be accurately communicated in writing by the additive manufacturer to each fuel manufacturer or detergent blender who purchases the subject detergent for purpose of compliance with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, and to any additive manufacturer who purchases the subject additive with the intent of reselling it to a fuel manufacturer for this purpose.
 (d) The rate at which a detergent blender treats gasoline with a detergent additive package must be no less than the minimum recommended concentration reported for the subject detergent additive pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, except under the following conditions:
 (1) If a detergent blender possesses deposit control performance test results as specified in § 80.165, § 80.166, or § 80.176 which show that the minimum treat rate recommended by the manufacturer of a detergent additive product exceeds the amount of that detergent actually required for effective deposit control, then, upon informing EPA in writing of these circumstances, the detergent blender may use the detergent at the lower concentration substantiated by these test results.
 (2) The notification to EPA must clearly specify the name of the detergent product and its manufacturer, the concentration recommended by the detergent manufacturer, and the lower concentration which the detergent blender intends to use. The notification must also attest that the required data are available to substantiate the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent at the intended lower concentration. The notification must be sent by certified mail to the address specified in § 80.174(b).

 (3) At its discretion, EPA may require that the detergent blender submit the test data purported to substantiate the claimed effectiveness of the lower concentration of the detergent additive. In addition, EPA may require the manufacturer of the subject detergent additive to submit test data substantiating the minimum recommended concentration specified in the detergent additive registration. In either case, EPA will send a letter to the appropriate party; the supporting data will be due to EPA within 30 days of receipt of EPA's letter.
 (i) If the detergent blender fails to submit the required supporting data to EPA in the allotted time period, or if EPA judges the submitted data to be inadequate to support the detergent blender's claim that the lower concentration provides a level of deposit control consistent with the requirements of this section, then EPA will disapprove the use of the detergent at the lower concentration. Further, the detergent blender may be subject to applicable liabilities and penalties pursuant to §§ 80.169 and 80.172 for any gasoline or PRC it has additized at the lower concentration.
 (ii) If the detergent manufacturer fails to submit the required test data to EPA within the allotted time period, EPA will proceed on the assumption that data are not available to substantiate the minimum recommended concentration specified in the detergent registration, and the subject additive may be disqualified for use in complying with the requirements of this subpart, pursuant to the procedures in paragraph (e) of this section. The detergent manufacturer may also be subject to applicable liabilities and penalties in §§ 80.169 and 80.172.
 (iii) If both parties submit the required information, EPA will evaluate the quality and results of both sets of test data, and will either approve or disapprove the use of the lower treat rate submitted by the detergent blender. EPA will inform both parties of the results of its analysis.
 (e) Disqualification of a detergent additive package. (1) When EPA makes a preliminary determination that a detergent additive certifier has failed to comply with the detergent certification requirements of this section, including a failure to submit required materials for a detergent additive or submission of materials which EPA deems inadequate, or if a detergent additive fails confirmatory testing conducted pursuant to § 80.167, EPA shall notify the additive certifier by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth the basis for that determination and informing the certifier that the detergent may lose its eligibility to be used to comply with the detergency requirements of this section.

 (2) If EPA determines that the detergent certification was created by fraud or other misconduct, such as a negligent disregard for the truthfulness or accuracy of the required information, the detergent certification will be considered void ab initio and the disqualification will be retroactive to July 1, 1997 or the date on which the additive product was first certified, whichever is later.
 (3) The certifier will be afforded 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent of detergent disqualification to submit written comments concerning the notice, and to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the specific requirements which provide the basis for the proposed disqualification. If the certifier does not respond in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent of disqualification, the detergent disqualification shall become final and the Administrator shall notify the certifier of such final disqualification order. If the certifier responds in writing within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to disqualify, the Administrator shall review and consider all comments submitted by the certifier before taking final action concerning the proposed disqualification. All correspondence regarding a disqualification must be sent to the address provided in § 80.174(b).

 (4) As part of a written response to a notice of intent to disqualify, a certifier may request an informal hearing concerning the notice. Any such request shall state with specificity the information the certifier wishes to present at such a hearing. If an informal hearing is requested, EPA shall schedule such a hearing within 90 days from the date of receipt of the request. If an informal hearing is held, the subject matter of the hearing shall be confined solely to whether or not the certifier has complied with the specific requirements which provide the basis for the proposed disqualification. If an informal hearing is held, the designated presiding officer may be any EPA employee, the hearing procedures shall be informal, and the hearing shall not be subject to or governed by 40 CFR part 22 or by 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, or 557. A verbatim transcript of each informal hearing shall be kept and the Administrator (or designee) shall consider all relevant evidence and arguments presented at the hearing in making a final decision concerning a proposed disqualification.

 (5) If a certifier who has received a notice of intent to disqualify submits a timely written response, and the Administrator (or designee) decides after reviewing the response and the transcript of any informal hearing to disqualify the detergent for use in complying with the requirements of this subpart, the Administrator (or designee) shall issue a final disqualification order and forward a copy of the disqualification order to the certifier by certified mail. Notice of the disqualification order will also be published in the Federal Register. The disqualification will become effective as of the date on which the copy of the order is received by the certifier. If the certifier is also a blender of the disqualified additive, then the certifier must stop using the ineligible detergent upon receipt of the disqualification order.

 (6) Within 10 days of receipt of EPA's notification of the final decision to disqualify a detergent additive package pursuant to this paragraph (e), the detergent certifier must submit to EPA, at the address specified in § 80.174(b), a list of its customers who use the disqualified detergent. Failure to do so may subject the certifier to liabilities for violations of § 80.168 that result from the use of the uncertified detergent. EPA shall inform the certifier's customers by certified mail that the detergent is no longer eligible for compliance with the requirements of this subpart.

(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section the terms below are defined as follows:
An agglomerate is a collection of weakly bound particles or aggregates or mixtures of the two where the resulting external surface area is similar to the sum of the surface areas of the individual components.
An aggregate is a particle comprising strongly bonded or fused particles where the resulting external surface area may be significantly smaller than the sum of calculated surface areas of the individual components.
Central Data Exchange or CDX means EPA's centralized electronic submission receiving system.
CISS tool means the Chemical Information Submission System, EPA's electronic, web-based reporting tool for the completion and submission of data, reports, and other information, or its successors.
Discrete form of a reportable chemical substance differs from another form of the same reportable chemical substance in one or more of the following 3 characteristics: (i) The change in the reportable chemical substance is due to all of the following:
(A) There is a change in process to effect a change in size, a change in one or more of the properties of the reportable chemical substances identified in paragraph (i)(C) of this definition, or both;
(B) There is a size variation in the mean particle size that is greater than 7 times the standard deviation of the mean particle size (± 7 times the standard deviation); and
(C) There is a change in at least one of the following properties: Zeta potential, specific surface area, dispersion stability, or surface reactivity, that is greater than 7 times the standard deviation of the measured value (± 7 times the standard deviation).
(ii) The reportable chemical substance has a different morphology. Examples of morphologies include but are not limited to sphere, rod, ellipsoid, cylinder, needle, wire, fiber, cage, hollow shell, tree, flower, ring, torus, cone, and sheet.
(iii) A reportable chemical substance that is coated with another chemical substance or mixture at the end of manufacturing or processing has a coating that consists of a different chemical substance or mixture.
Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program was a program conducted by EPA from January 2008 to December 2009 under which some nanoscale material manufacturers and processors voluntarily provided EPA available information on engineered nanoscale materials that were manufactured, processed or used.
Particle is a minute piece of matter with defined physical boundaries.
Primary particles are particles or droplets that form during manufacture of a chemical substance before aggregation or agglomerization occurs.
Reportable chemical substance is a chemical substance as defined in section 3 of TSCA that is solid at 25 °C and standard atmospheric pressure, that is manufactured or processed in a form where any particles, including aggregates and agglomerates, are in the size range of 1-100 nm in at least one dimension, and that is manufactured or processed to exhibit unique and novel properties because of its size. A reportable chemical substance does not include a chemical substance that is manufactured or processed in a form where less than 1% of any particles, including aggregates, and agglomerates, measured by weight are in the size range of 1-100 nm.
Small manufacturer or processor means any manufacturer or processor whose total annual sales, when combined with those of its parent company (if any), are less than $11 million. The definition of small manufacturer in section 704.3 of this title does not apply to reporting under this section (40 CFR 704.20).
Specific surface area means the ratio of the area of the surface of the reportable chemical substance to its mass or volume. Specific surface area by mass is the ratio of the area of the surface of a nanoscale material divided by the mass (m2/kg) and the specific surface area by volume is the area of the surface of the reportable chemical substance divided by its volume m2/m3.
Surface reactivity means the reactivity at the surface of a reportable chemical substance. It is dependent upon factors such as redox potential, which is a measure of the tendency of a substance to lose or acquire electrons, photocatalytic activity, including the potential to generate free radicals.
Unique and novel properties means any size-dependent properties that vary from those associated with other forms or sizes of the same chemical substance, and such properties are a reason that the chemical substance is manufactured or processed in that form or size.
Zeta potential is the electrostatic potential near the particle surface.

The survey program plan shall specify the sampling strata, clusters and area, and number of samples to be included. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in order to comply with this paragraph the survey plan need not be conducted by a consortium.
 (b) Survey option 2. (1) To comply with the requirements under this paragraph (b), any gasoline refiner, gasoline importer, ethanol blender, ethanol producer, or ethanol importer who manufactures, introduces into commerce, sells or offers for sale E15, gasoline, blendstock for oxygenate blending, ethanol, or gasoline-ethanol blend intended for use in or as E15 must participate in a consortium which arranges to have an independent survey association conduct a statistically valid program of compliance surveys pursuant to a survey program plan which has been approved by EPA, in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) and (b)(6) of this section.
 (2) The consortium survey program under this paragraph (b) must be:
 (i) Planned and conducted by a survey association that is independent of the ethanol blenders, ethanol producers, ethanol importers, gasoline refiners, and/or gasoline importers that arrange to have the survey conducted. In order to be considered independent:
 (A) Representatives of the survey association shall not be an employee of any ethanol blender, ethanol producer, ethanol importer, gasoline refiner, or gasoline importer;
 (B) The survey association shall be free from any obligation to or interest in any ethanol blender, ethanol producer, ethanol importer, gasoline refiner, or gasoline importer; and
 (C) The ethanol blenders, ethanol producers, ethanol importers, gasoline refiners, and/or gasoline importers that arrange to have the survey conducted shall be free from any obligation to or interest in the survey association.
 (ii) Conducted at retail outlets that sell gasoline; and
 (iii) Represent all gasoline dispensed nationwide.
 (3) Independent Survey Association Requirements. The consortium described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall require the independent survey association conducting the surveys to:
 (i) Submit to EPA for approval each calendar year a proposed survey program plan in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
 (ii) Obtain samples of gasoline offered for sale at gasoline retail outlets in accordance with the survey program plan approved under this paragraph (b), or immediately notify EPA of any refusal of retail outlets to allow samples to be taken.
 (iii) Test, or arrange to be tested, the samples required under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section for Reid vapor pressure (RVP), and oxygenate content as follows:
 (A) Samples collected at retail outlets shall be shipped the same day the samples are collected via ground service to the laboratory and analyzed for oxygenate content. Samples collected at a dispenser labeled E15 in any manner, or at a tank serving such a dispenser, shall also be analyzed for RVP. Such analysis shall be completed within 10 days after receipt of the sample in the laboratory. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require RVP testing of a sample from any dispenser or tank serving it unless the dispenser is labeled E15 in any manner.

 (B) Any laboratory to be used by the independent survey association for oxygenate or RVP testing shall be approved by EPA and its test method for determining oxygenate content shall be a method permitted under § 80.46(g), and its test method for determining RVP shall be the method permitted under § 80.46(b).
 
 (iv) In the case of any test that yields a result that does not match the label affixed to the product (e.g., a sample greater than 15.0 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser labeled as “E15” or a sample containing greater than 10.0 volume percent ethanol and not more than 15.0 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser not labeled as “E15”), or the RVP standard of § 80.27(a)(2), the independent survey association shall, within 24 hours after the laboratory receives the sample, send notification of the test result as follows:
 (A) In the case of a sample collected at a retail outlet at which the brand name of a gasoline refiner or gasoline importer is displayed, to the gasoline refiner or gasoline importer, and EPA. This initial notification to a gasoline refiner or gasoline importer shall include specific information concerning the name and address of the retail outlet, contact information, the brand, and the ethanol content, and the RVP if required, of the sample.

 (C) The independent survey association shall provide notice to the identified contact person or persons for each party in writing (which includes e-mail or facsimile) and, if requested by the identified contact person, by telephone.
 (v) Confirm that each fuel dispenser sampled is labeled as required in § 80.1501 by confirming that:
 (A) The label meets the appearance and content requirements of § 80.1501.
 (B) The label is located on the fuel dispenser according to the requirements in § 80.1501.
 (vi) In the case of a fuel dispenser that is improperly labeled, or whose fuel does not meet the RVP standards of § 80.27(a)(2) the survey association shall provide notice as provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section.
 (vii) Provide to EPA quarterly and annual summary survey reports which include the information specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
 (viii) Maintain all records relating to the surveys conducted under this paragraph (b) for a period of at least five (5) years.
 (ix) Permit any representative of EPA to monitor at any time the conducting of the surveys, including sample collection, transportation, storage, and analysis.
 (4) Survey Plan Design Requirements. The proposed survey program plan required under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section shall, at a minimum, include the following:
 (i) Number of Surveys. The survey program plan shall include four quarterly surveys each calendar year. The four quarterly surveys collectively are called the survey series as defined in § 80.1500.
 (ii) Sampling Areas. The survey program plan shall include sampling in all sampling strata, as defined in § 80.1500, during each survey. These sampling strata shall be further divided into discrete sampling areas or clusters. Each survey shall include sampling in at least 40 sampling areas in each stratum which are randomly selected.
 (iii) No advance notice of surveys. The survey plan shall include procedures to keep the identification of the sampling areas that are included in any survey plan confidential from any regulated party prior to the beginning of a survey in an area. However, this information shall not be kept confidential from EPA.
 (iv) Retail outlet selection.
 
 (A) The retail outlets to be sampled in a sampling area shall be selected from among all retail outlets in the sampling area that sell gasoline, with the probability of selection proportionate to the volume of gasoline sold at the retail outlets; the sample should also include retail outlets with different brand names as well as those retail outlets that are unbranded.

 (B) In the case of any retail outlet from which a sample of gasoline was collected during a survey and determined to have an ethanol content that does not match the fuel dispenser label (e.g. a sample greater than 15.0 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser labeled as “E15” or a sample with greater than 10.0 volume percent ethanol and not more than 15.0 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser not labeled as “E15”) or determined to have a dispenser containing fuel whose RVP does not comply with § 80.27(a)(2), that retail outlet shall be included in the subsequent survey.
 (C) One sample of each product dispensed as gasoline shall be collected at each retail outlet, and separate samples shall be taken that represent the gasoline contained in each gasoline storage tank unless collection of separate samples is not practicable.
 (v) Number of samples.
 
 (A) The minimum number of samples to be included in the survey plan for each calendar year shall be calculated as follows:
 
 
 [Please see PDF for image: er25JY11.003] 
 
 
 
 Where:
 
 
 n = minimum number of samples in a year-long survey series. However, in no case shall n be smaller than 7,500.
 Za = upper percentile point from the normal distribution to achieve a one-tailed 95% confidence level (5% a-level). Thus, Za equals 1.645.
 Zß = upper percentile point to achieve 95% power. Thus, Zß equals 1.645.
 
 
 l = the maximum proportion of non-compliant stations for a region to be deemed compliant. In this test, the parameter needs to be 5% or greater, i.e., 5% or more of the stations, within a stratum such that the region is considered non-compliant. For this survey, 
 1 will be 5%.
 
 
 o= the underlying proportion of non-compliant stations in a sample. For the first survey plan, 
 o = will be 2.3%. For subsequent survey plans, 
 o = will be the average of the proportion of stations found to be non-compliant over the previous four surveys.
 Stn = number of sampling strata. For purposes of this survey program, Stn equals 3.
 Fa = adjustment factor for the number of extra samples required to compensate for collected samples that cannot be included in the survey, based on the number of additional samples required during the previous four surveys. However, in no case shall the value of Fa be smaller than 1.1.
 Fb = adjustment factor for the number of samples required to resample each retail outlet with test results exceeding the labeled amount (e.g., a sample greater than 15.0 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser labeled as “E15”, a sample with greater than 10.0 volume percent ethanol and not more than 15.0 volume percent ethanol dispensed from a fuel dispenser not labeled as “E15”), or a sample dispensed from a fuel dispenser labeled as “E15” with greater than the applicable seasonal and geographic RVP pursuant to § 80.27, based on the rate of resampling required during the previous four surveys. However, in no case shall the value of Fb be smaller than 1.1.
 Sun = number of surveys per year. For purposes of this survey program, Sun equals 4.
 
 
 (B) The number of samples determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(v)(A) of this section, after being incremented as necessary to allocate whole numbers of samples to each cluster, shall be distributed approximately equally for the quarterly surveys conducted during the calendar year.
 (5) Summary survey reports. The quarterly and annual summary survey reports required under paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section shall include the following information:
 (i) An identification of the parties that are participating in the survey.
 (ii) The identification of each sampling area included in a survey and the dates that the samples were collected in that area.
 (iii) For each retail outlet sampled:
 (A) The identification of the retail outlet;
 (B) The gasoline refiner or gasoline importer brand name displayed, if any;
 (C) The fuel dispenser labeling (e.g., “E15”);
 (D) The sample test result for oxygenate content, and RVP result, if any;
 (E) The test method used to determine oxygenate content under § 80.46(g); and
 (F) The test method used to determine RVP under § 80.46(b).

 (iv) Ethanol level summary statistics by brand and unbranded for each sampling area, strata, and survey series. These summary statistics shall:
 
 (A) Include the number of samples, the average, median and range of ethanol content, expressed in volume percent.
 (B) [Reserved]
 (v) The quarterly reports required under this paragraph (b)(5) are due 60 days following the end of the quarter. The annual reports required under this paragraph (b)(5) are due 60 days following the end of the calendar year.
 (vi) The reports required under this paragraph (b)(5) shall be submitted to EPA in an electronic spreadsheet.

 § 14.82
 Alternatives and exceptions to the marking requirement.
 (a) The requirements of § 14.81 may be met by complying with one of the following alternatives to the marking requirement:
 (1)(i) Conspicuously marking the outside of each container or package containing fish or wildlife with the word “fish” or “wildlife” as appropriate for its contents, or with the common name of its contents by species, and
 (ii) Including an invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or similar document to accompany the shipment which accurately states the name and address of the shipper and consignee, states the total number of packages or containers in the shipment, and for each species in the shipment specifies:
 (A) The common name that identifies the species (examples include: Chinook (or king) salmon; bluefin tuna; and whitetail deer) and whether or not the listed species is venomous; and
 (B) The number of that species (or other appropriate measure of quantity such as gross or net weight).
 The invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or equivalent document must be securely attached to the outside of one container or package in the shipment or otherwise physically accompany the shipment in a manner which makes it readily accessible for inspection; or
 (2) Affixing the shipper's wildlife import/export license number preceded by the three letters “FWS” on the outside of each container or package containing fish or wildlife, if the shipper has valid wildlife import/export license issued under authority of 50 CFR part 14. For each shipment marked in accordance with this paragraph, the records maintained under § 14.93(c) must include a copy of the invoice, packing list, bill of lading, or other similar document that accurately states the information required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

 (3) In the case of subcontainers or packages within a larger packing container, only the outermost container must be marked in accordance with this section. Except, that for live fish or wildlife that are packed in subcontainers within a larger packing container, if the subcontainers are numbered or labeled, the packing list, invoice, bill or lading, or other similar document, must reflect that number or label. However, each subcontainer containing a venomous species must be clearly marked as venomous.
 (4) A conveyance (truck, plane, boat, etc.) is not considered a container for purposes of requiring specific marking of the conveyance itself, provided that:
 (i) The fish or wildlife within the conveyance is carried loosely or is readily identifiable, and is accompanied by the document required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, or
 (ii) The fish or wildlife is otherwise packaged and marked in accordance with this subpart.
 (b) The requirements of § 14.81 do not apply to containers or packages containing—
 (1) Fox, nutria, rabbit, mink, chinchilla, marten, fisher, muskrat, and karakul that have been bred and born in captivity, or their products, if a signed statement certifying that the animals were bred and born in captivity accompanies the shipping documents;

 (2) Fish or shellfish contained in retail consumer packages labeled pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.; or
 (3) Fish or shellfish that are landed by, and offloaded from, a fishing vessel (whether or not the catch has been carried by the fishing vessel interstate), as long as the fish or shellfish remain at the place where first offloaded.

United States of America,World [Valid From: 05 Dec 2012],B85,Traceability requirements,"§1115.2 (b), (c), (d)
(b) Section 15(b) of the CPSA requires every manufacturer (including an importer), distributor, and retailer of a consumer product distributed in commerce who obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that the product fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule, fails to comply with a voluntary consumer product safety standard upon which the Commission has relied under section 9 of the CPSA, contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard described in subsection 15(a)(2) of the CPSA, or creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death, immediately to inform the Commission, unless the manufacturer (including an importer), distributor or retailer has actual knowledge that the Commission has been adequately informed of such failure to comply, defect, or risk. This provision indicates that a broad spectrum of safety related information should be reported under section 15(b) of the CPSA.
 (c) Sections 15 (c) and (d) of the CPSA, (15 U.S.C. 2064(c) and (d)), empower the Commission to order a manufacturer (including an importer), distributor, or retailer of a consumer product distributed in commerce that presents a substantial product hazard to give various forms of notice to the public of the defect or the failure to comply and/or to order the subject firm to elect either to repair, to replace, or to refund the purchase price of such product. However, information which should be reported under section 15(b) of the CPSA does not automatically indicate the presence of a substantial product hazard, because what must be reported under section 15(b) are failures to comply with consumer product safety rules or voluntary standards upon which the Commission has relied under section 9, defects that could create a substantial product hazard, and products which create an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. (See § 1115.12.)
 (d) The provisions of this part 1115 deal with all consumer products (including imports) subject to regulation under the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 2051-2081) (CPSA), and the Refrigerator Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1211-1214) (RSA). In addition, the Commission has found that risks of injury to the public from consumer products subject to regulation under the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191-1204) (FFA), the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261-1274) (FHSA), and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 1471-1476) (PPPA) cannot be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent in a timely fashion under those acts. Therefore, pursuant to section 30(d) of the CPSA (15 U.S.C. 2079(d)), manufacturers (including importers), distributors, and retailers of consumer products which are subject to regulation under provisions of the FFA, FHSA, and PPPA must comply with the reporting requirements of section 15(b).

§ 1115.4
 Section 15(b)(2) of the CPSA requires every manufacturer (including an importer), distributor, and retailer of a consumer product who obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that the product contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard to inform the Commission of such defect. Thus, whether the information available reasonably suggests a defect is the first determination which a subject firm must make in deciding whether it has obtained information which must be reported to the Commission. In determining whether it has obtained information which reasonably supports the conclusion that its consumer product contains a defect, a subject firm may be guided by the criteria the Commission and staff use in determining whether a defect exists. At a minimum, defect includes the dictionary or commonly accepted meaning of the word. Thus, a defect is a fault, flaw, or irregularity that causes weakness, failure, or inadequacy in form or function. A defect, for example, may be the result of a manufacturing or production error; that is, the consumer product as manufactured is not in the form intended by, or fails to perform in accordance with, its design. In addition, the design of and the materials used in a consumer product may also result in a defect. Thus, a product may contain a defect even if the product is manufactured exactly in accordance with its design and specifications, if the design presents a risk of injury to the public. A design defect may also be present if the risk of injury occurs as a result of the operation or use of the product or the failure of the product to operate as intended. A defect can also occur in a product's contents, construction, finish, packaging, warnings, and/or instructions. With respect to instructions, a consumer product may contain a defect if the instructions for assembly or use could allow the product, otherwise safely designed and manufactured, to present a risk of injury. To assist subject firms in understanding the concept of defect as used in the CPSA, the following examples are offered:
 (a) An electric appliance presents a shock hazard because, through a manufacturing error, its casing can be electrically charged by full-line voltage. This product contains a defect as a result of manufacturing or production error.
 (b) Shoes labeled and marketed for long-distance running are so designed that they might cause or contribute to the causing of muscle or tendon injury if used for long-distance running. The shoes are defective due to the labeling and marketing.
 (c) A kite made of electrically conductive material presents a risk of electrocution if it is long enough to become entangled in power lines and be within reach from the ground. The electrically conductive material contributes both to the beauty of the kite and the hazard it presents. The kite contains a design defect.

 (d) A power tool is not accompanied by adequate instructions and safety warnings. Reasonably foreseeable consumer use or misuse, based in part on the lack of adequate instructions and safety warnings, could result in injury. Although there are no reports of injury, the product contains a defect because of the inadequate warnings and instructions.
 
 (e) An exhaust fan for home garages is advertised as activating when carbon monoxide fumes reach a dangerous level but does not exhaust when fumes have reached the dangerous level. Although the cause of the failure to exhaust is not known, the exhaust fan is defective because users rely on the fan to remove the fumes and the fan does not do so.
 However, not all products which present a risk of injury are defective. For example, a knife has a sharp blade and is capable of seriously injuring someone. This very sharpness, how- ever, is necessary if the knife is to function adequately. The knife does not contain a defect insofar as the sharpness of its blade is concerned, despite its potential for causing injury, because the risk of injury is outweighed by the usefulness of the product which is made possible by the same aspect which presents the risk of injury. In determining whether the risk of injury associated with a product is the type of risk which will render the product defective, the Commission and staff will consider, as appropriate: The utility of the product involved; the nature of the risk of injury which the product presents; the necessity for the product; the population exposed to the product and its risk of injury; the obviousness of such risk; the adequacy of warnings and instructions to mitigate such risk; the role of consumer misuse of the product and the foreseeability of such misuse; the Commission's own experience and expertise; the case law interpreting Federal and State public health and safety statutes; the case law in the area of products liability; and other factors relevant to the determination. If the information available to a subject firm does not reasonably support the conclusion that a defect exists, the subject firm need not report. However, if the information does reasonably support the conclusion that a defect exists, the subject firm must then consider whether that defect could create a substantial product hazard. (See § 1115.12(f) for factors to be assessed in determining whether a substantial product hazard could exist.) If the subject firm determines that the defect could create a substantial product hazard, the subject firm must report to the Commission. Most defects could present a substantial product hazard if the public is exposed to significant numbers of defective products or if the possible injury is serious or is likely to occur. Since the extent of public exposure and/or the likelihood or seriousness of injury are ordinarily not known at the time a defect first manifests itself, subject firms are urged to report if in doubt as to whether a defect could present a substantial product hazard. On a case-by-case basis the Commission and the staff will determine whether a defect within the meaning of section 15 of the CPSA does, in fact, exist and whether that defect presents a substantial product hazard. Since a consumer product may be defective even if it is designed, manufactured, and marketed exactly as intended by a subject firm, subject firms should report if in doubt as to whether a defect exists. Defect, as discussed in this section and as used by the Commission and staff, pertains only to interpreting and enforcing the Consumer Product Safety Act. The criteria and discussion in this section are not intended to apply to any other area of the law.

§1115.6
(a) General provision. Every manufacturer, distributor, and retailer of a consumer product distributed in commerce who obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that its product creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death is required to notify the Commission immediately. 15 U.S.C. 2064(b)(3). The requirement that notification occur when a responsible party “obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that” its product creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death is intended to require firms to report even when no final determination of the risk is possible. Firms must carefully analyze the information they obtain to determine whether such information “reasonably supports” a determination that the product creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. (See § 1115.12(f) for a discussion of the kinds of information that firms must study and evaluate to determine whether they have an obligation to report.) Firms that obtain information indicating that their products present an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death should not wait for such serious injury or death to actually occur before reporting. Such information can include reports from experts, test reports, product liability lawsuits or claims, consumer or customer complaints, quality control data, scientific or epidemiological studies, reports of injury, information from other firms or governmental entities, and other relevant information. While such information shall not trigger a per se reporting requirement, in its evaluation of whether a subject firm is required to file a report under the provisions of section 15 of the CPSA, the Commission shall attach considerable significance if such firm learns that a court or jury has determined that one of its products has caused a serious injury or death and a reasonable person could conclude based on the lawsuit and other information obtained by the firm that the product creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death.
 (b) Unreasonable risk. The use of the term “unreasonable risk” suggests that the risk of injury presented by a product should be evaluated to determine if that risk is a reasonable one. In determining whether a product presents an unreasonable risk, the firm should examine the utility of the product, or the utility of the aspect of the product that causes the risk, the level of exposure of consumers to the risk, the nature and severity of the hazard presented, and the likelihood of resulting serious injury or death. In its analysis, the firm should also evaluate the state of the manufacturing or scientific art, the availability of alternative designs or products, and the feasibility of eliminating the risk. The Commission expects firms to report if a reasonable person could conclude given the information available that a product creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. In its evaluation of whether a subject firm is required to file a report under the provisions of section 15 of the CPSA the Commission shall, as a practical matter, attach considerable significance if such firm obtains information which reasonably supports the conclusion that its product violates a standard or ban promulgated under the FHSA, FFA, PPPA or RSA and the violation could result in serious injury or death.
 (c) Serious injury or death. The term “serious injury” is not defined in the CPSA. The Commission believes that the term includes not only the concept of “grievous bodily injury,” defined at § 1115.12(d), but also any other significant injury. Injuries necessitating hospitalization which require actual medical or surgical treatment, fractures, lacerations requiring sutures, concussions, injuries to the eye, ear, or internal organs requiring medical treatment, and injuries necessitating absence from school or work of more than one day are examples of situations in which the Commission shall presume that such a serious injury has occurred. To determine whether an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death exists, the firm should evaluate chronic or long term health effects as well as immediate injuries.

 §1115.7
The reporting requirements of section 37 of the CPSA (15 U.S.C. 2084) are in addition to the requirement in section 15 of the CPSA. Section 37 requires a product manufacturer to report certain kinds of lawsuit information. It is intended as a supplement to, not a substitute for, the requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA. Whether or not a firm has an obligation to provide information under section 37, it must consider whether it has obtained information which reasonably supports the conclusion that its product violates a consumer product safety rule, does not comply with a voluntary safety standard upon which the Commission has relied under section 9, contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard, or creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. If a firm has obtained such information, it must report under section 15(b) of the CPSA, whether or not it is required to report under section 37. Further, in many cases the Commission would expect to receive reports under section 15(b) long before the obligation to report under section 37 arises since firms have frequently obtained reportable information before settlements or judgments in their product liability lawsuits.

§1115.8(b)
(b) Mandatory standards. The CPSA requires that firms comply with all applicable mandatory consumer product safety standards and to report to the Commission any products which do not comply with either mandatory standards or voluntary standards upon which the Commission has relied. As is the case with voluntary consumer product safety standards, compliance or non-compliance with applicable mandatory safety standards may be considered by the Commission and staff in making relevant determinations and exercising relevant authorities under the CPSA and other federal statutes. Thus, for example, while compliance with a relevant mandatory product safety standard does not, of itself, relieve a firm from the need to report to the Commission a product defect that creates a substantial product hazard under section 15 of the CPSA, it will be considered by staff in making the determination of whether and what type of corrective action may be required.

§1115.10
(a) Every manufacturer (including importer), distributor, or retailer of a consumer product that has been distributed in commerce who obtains information that such consumer product contains a defect which could create a substantial risk of injury to the public shall immediately notify the Office of Compliance, Division of Corrective Actions, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207 (telephone: 301-504-0608), or such other persons as may be designated. Manufacturers (including importers), distributors, and retailers of consumer products subject to regulation by the Commission under provisions of the FFA, FHSA, PPPA, as well as consumer products subject to regulation under the CPSA and RSA, must comply with this requirement.
 (b) Every manufacturer (including importer), distributor, or retailer of a consumer product that has been distributed in commerce who obtains information that such consumer product fails to comply with an applicable consumer product safety standard or ban issued under the CPSA shall immediately notify the Commission's Office of Compliance and Enforcement, Division of Corrective Actions or such other persons as may be designated. A subject firm need not report a failure to comply with a standard or regulation issued under the provisions of the RSA, FFA, FHSA, or PPPA unless it can be reasonably concluded that the failure to comply results in a defect which could create a substantial product hazard. (See paragraph (a) of this section.)
 (c) Every manufacturer (including importer), distributor, and retailer of a consumer product that has been distributed in commerce who obtains information that such consumer product fails to comply with a voluntary consumer product safety standard upon which the Commission has relied under section 9 of the CPSA, shall immediately notify the Commission's Office of Compliance and Enforcement, Division of Corrective Actions or such other persons as may be designated.

 (d) Every manufacturer (including importer), distributor, and retailer of a consumer product that has been distributed in commerce who obtains information that such consumer product creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death shall immediately notify the Commission's Office of Compliance and Enforcement, Division of Corrective Actions or such other persons as may be designated. This obligation applies to manufacturers, distributors and retailers of consumer products subject to regulation by the Commission under the Flammable Fabrics Act, Federal Hazardous Substances Act, Poison Prevention Packaging Act, and Refrigerator Safety Act as well as products subject to regulation under the CPSA.
 (e) A distributor or retailer of a consumer product (who is neither a manufacturer nor an importer of that product) is subject to the reporting requirements of section 15(b) of the CPSA but may satisfy them by following the procedure detailed in § 1115.13(b).
 (f) A manufacturer (including an importer), distributor, or retailer need not inform the Commission under section 15(b) of the CPSA if that person has actual knowledge that the Commission has been adequately informed of the defect or failure to comply. (See section 15(b) of the CPSA.)

§1115.12
(a) General. Subject firms should not delay reporting in order to determine to a certainty the existence of a reportable noncompliance, defect or unreasonable risk. The obligation to report arises upon receipt of information from which one could reasonably conclude the existence of a reportable noncompliance, defect which could create a substantial product hazard, or unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. Thus, an obligation to report may arise when a subject firm received the first information regarding a potential hazard, noncompliance or risk. (See § 1115.14(c).) A subject firm in its report to the Commission need not admit, or may specifically deny, that the information it submits reasonably supports the conclusion that its consumer product is noncomplying, contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard within the meaning of section 15(b) of the CPSA, or creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. After receiving the report, the staff may conduct further investigation and will preliminarily determine whether the product reported upon presents a substantial product hazard. This determination can be based on information supplied by a subject firm or from any other source. If the matter is adjudicated, the Commission will ultimately make the decision as to substantial product hazard or will seek to have a court make the decision as to imminent product hazard.
 (b) Failure to comply. A subject firm must report information indicating that a consumer product which it has distributed in commerce does not comply with an applicable consumer product safety standard or ban issued under the CPSA, or a voluntary consumer product safety standard upon which the Commission has relied under section 9 of the CPSA.
 (c) Unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. A subject firm must report when it obtains information indicating that a consumer product which it has distributed in commerce creates an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death.
 (d) Death or grievous bodily injury. Information indicating that a noncompliance or a defect in a consumer product has caused, may have caused, or contributed to the causing, or could cause or contribute to the causing of a death or grievous bodily injury (e.g., mutilation, amputation/dismemberment, disfigurement, loss of important bodily functions, debilitating internal disorders, severe burns, severe electrical shocks, and injuries likely to require extended hospitalization) must be reported, unless the subject firm has investigated and determined that the information is not reportable.
 (e) Other information indicating a defect or noncompliance. Even if there are no reports of a potential for or an actual death or grievous bodily injury, other information may indicate a reportable defect or noncompliance. In evaluating whether or when a subject firm should have reported, the Commission will deem a subject firm to know what a reasonable and prudent manufacturer (including an importer), distributor, or retailer would know. (See § 1115.11.)
 (f) Information which should be studied and evaluated. Paragraphs (f)(1) through (7) of this section are examples of information which a subject firm should study and evaluate in order to determine whether it is obligated to report under section 15(b) of the CPSA. Such information may include information that a firm has obtained, or reasonably should have obtained in accordance with § 1115.11, about product use, experience, performance, design, or manufacture outside the United States that is relevant to products sold or distributed in the United States. All information should be evaluated to determine whether it suggests the existence of a noncompliance, a defect, or an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death:
 (1) Information about engineering, quality control, or production data.
 (2) Information about safety-related production or design change(s).
 (3) Product liability suits and/or claims for personal injury or damage.
 (4) Information from an independent testing laboratory.
 (5) Complaints from a consumer or consumer group.
 (6) Information received from the Commission or other governmental agency.
 (7) Information received from other firms, including requests to return a product or for replacement or credit. This includes both requests made by distributors and retailers to the manufacturer and requests from the manufacturer that products be returned.
 (g) Evaluating substantial risk of injury. Information which should be or has been reported under section 15(b) of the CPSA does not automatically indicate the presence of a substantial product hazard. On a case-by-case basis the Commission and the staff will determine whether a defect or noncompliance exists and whether it results in a substantial risk of injury to the public. In deciding whether to report, subject firms may be guided by the following criteria the staff and the Commission use in determining whether a substantial product hazard exists:
 (1) Hazard created by defect. Section 15(a)(2) of the CPSA lists factors to be considered in determining whether a defect creates a substantial risk of injury. These factors are set forth in the disjunctive. Therefore, the exist- ence of any one of the factors could create a substantial product hazard. The Commission and the staff will consider some or all of the following factors, as appropriate, in determining the substantiality of a hazard created by a product defect:
 (i) Pattern of defect. The Commission and the staff will consider whether the defect arises from the design, composition, contents, construction, finish, packaging, warnings, or instructions of the product or from some other cause and will consider the conditions under which the defect manifests itself.
 (ii) Number of defective products distributed in commerce. Even one defective product can present a substantial risk of injury and provide a basis for a substantial product hazard determination under section 15 of the CPSA if the injury which might occur is serious and/or if the injury is likely to occur. However, a few defective products with no potential for causing serious injury and little likelihood of injuring even in a minor way will not ordinarily provide a proper basis for a substantial product hazard determination. The Commission also recognizes that the number of products remaining with consumers is a relevant consideration.
 (iii) Severity of the risk. A risk is severe if the injury which might occur is serious and/or if the injury is likely to occur. In considering the likelihood of any injury the Commission and the staff will consider the number of injuries reported to have occurred, the intended or reasonably foreseeable use or misuse of the product, and the population group exposed to the product (e.g., children, elderly, handicapped).
 (iv) Other considerations. The Commission and the staff will consider all other relevant factors.
 (2) Hazard presented by noncompliance. Section 15(a)(1) of the CPSA states that a substantial product hazard exists when a failure to comply with an applicable consumer product safety rule creates a substantial risk of injury to the public. Therefore, the Commission and staff will consider whether the noncompliance is likely to result in injury when determining whether the noncompliance creates a substantial product hazard. As appropriate, the Commission and staff may consider some or all of the factors set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section in reaching the substantial product hazard determination.

§1115.13(d)
(d) Full report. Subject firms which file initial reports are required to file full reports in accordance with this paragraph. Retailers and distributors may satisfy their reporting obligations in accordance with § 1115.13(b). At any time after an initial report, the staff may modify the requirements detailed in this section with respect to any subject firm. If the staff preliminarily determines that there is no substantial product hazard, it may inform the firm that its reporting obligation has been fulfilled. However, a subject firm would be required to report if it later became aware of new information indicating a reportable defect, noncompliance, or risk, whether the new information related to the same or another consumer product. Unless modified by staff action, the following information, to the extent that it is reasonably available and/or applicable, constitutes a “full report,” must be submitted to the staff, and must be supplemented or corrected as new or different information becomes known:
 (1) The name, address, and title of the person submitting the “full report” to the Commission.
 (2) The name and address of the manufacturer (or importer) of the product and the addresses of the manufacturing plants for that product.
 (3) An identification and description of the product(s). Give retail prices, model numbers, serial numbers, and date codes. Describe any identifying marks and their location on the product. Provide a picture or a sample of the product.
 (4) A description of the nature of the defect, failure to comply, or risk. If technical drawings, test results, schematics, diagrams, blueprints, or other graphic depictions are available, attach copies.
 (5) The nature of the injury or the possible injury associated with the product defect, failure to comply, or risk.
 (6) The manner in which and the date when the information about the defect, noncompliance, or risk (e.g., complaints, reported injuries, quality control testing) was obtained. If any complaints related to the safety of the product or any allegations or reports of injuries associated with the product have been received, copies of such complaints or reports (or a summary thereof) shall be attached. Give a chronological account of facts or events leading to the report under section 15(b) of the CPSA, beginning with receipt of the first information which ultimately led to the report. Also included may be an analysis of these facts or events.
 (7) The total number of products and units involved.
 (8) The dates when products and units were manufactured, imported, distributed, and sold at retail.
 (9) The number of products and units in each of the following: in the possession of the manufacturer or importer, in the possession of private labelers, in the possession of distributors, in the possession of retailers, and in the possession of consumers.

 (10) An explanation of any changes (e.g., designs, adjustments, and additional parts, quality control, testing) that have been or will be effected to correct the defect, failure to comply, or risk and of the steps that have been or will be taken to prevent similar occurrences in the future together with the timetable for implementing such changes and steps.
 
 (11) Information that has been or will be given to purchasers, including consumers, about the defect, noncompliance, or risk with a description of how this information has been or will be communicated. This shall include copies or drafts of any letters, press releases, warning labels, or other written information that has been or will be given to purchasers, including consumers.
 (12) The details of and schedule for any contemplated refund, replacement, or repair actions, including plans for disposing of returned products (e.g., repair, destroy, return to foreign manufacturer).
 (13) A detailed explanation and description of the marketing and distribution of the product from the manufacturer (including importer) to the consumer (e.g., use of sales representatives, independent contractors, and/or jobbers; installation of the product, if any, and by whom).
 (14) Upon request, the names and addresses of all distributors, retailers, and purchasers, including consumers.

All applicable base and premium fees will apply to each shipment.
 (6) We will charge 1 hour of time at 11/2 times the hourly labor rate for inspections beginning less than 1 hour before normal working hours.

A Service officer must clear all wildlife to be exported from the United States prior to the physical loading of the merchandise on a vehicle or aircraft, or the containerization or palletizing of such merchandise for export, unless a Service officer expressly authorizes otherwise. Such clearance does not constitute a certification of the legality of an importation or exportation under the laws or regulations of the United States.
 (b) An importer/exporter or his/her agent may obtain clearance by a Service officer only at designated ports (§ 14.12), at border ports (§ 14.16), at special ports (§ 14.19), or at a port where importation or exportation is authorized by a permit issued under subpart C of this part. An importer/exporter must return forthwith any wildlife released without a Service officer's clearance or clearance by Customs for the Service under authority of § 14.54 to a port where clearance may be obtained pursuant to this subpart.
 (c) To obtain clearance, the importer, exporter, or the importer's or exporter's agent will make available to a Service officer or a Customs officer acting under § 14.54:
 (1) All shipping documents (including bills of lading, waybills and packing lists or invoices);
 (2) All permits, licenses or other documents required by the laws or regulations of the United States;
 (3) All permits or other documents required by the laws or regulations of any foreign country;
 (4) The wildlife being imported or exported; and
 (5) Any documents and permits required by the country of export or re-export for the wildlife.

 (a) No person engaged in the packaging or labeling of any consumer commodity for distribution in commerce, and no person (other than a common carrier for hire, or a freight forwarder for hire) engaged in the distribution in commerce of any packaged or labeled consumer commodity, shall distribute or cause to be distributed in commerce any such commodity if such commodity is contained in a package, or if there is affixed to that commodity a label, which does not conform to the provisions of the Act and of the regulations in this part.
 (b) Persons engaged in business as wholesale or retail distributors of consumer commodities shall be subject to the Act and the regulations in this part to the extent that such persons are engaged in the packaging or labeling of consumer commodities, or prescribe or specify by any means the manner in which such consumer commodities are packaged or labeled.
 (c) Each packaged or labeled consumer commodity, unless it has been exempted through proceedings under section 5(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1454(b)), shall, upon being prepared for distribution in commerce or for sale at retail, and before being distributed in commerce or offered for sale at retail, be labeled in accordance with the requirements of the Act and the regulations in this part.
 (d) Each packaged or labeled consumer commodity, unless it has been exempted through proceedings under section 5(b) of the Act, shall bear a label specifying the identity of the commodity; the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor; the net quantity of contents; and the net quantity per serving, use or application, where there is a label representation as to the number of servings, uses, or applications obtainable from the commodity.

 (e) Regulations will be promulgated by the Commission exempting particular consumer commodities from one or more of the requirements of section 4 of the Act and the regulations thereunder to the extent and under such conditions as are consistent with the declared policy of the Act whenever the Commission finds that, because of the nature, form, or quantity of the particular consumer commodity, or for other good and sufficient reasons, full compliance with all the requirements otherwise applicable is impracticable or is not necessary for the adequate protection of consumers. Proceedings for the promulgation of such exempting regulations may be commenced by the Commission upon its own initiative or pursuant to petition filed with the Secretary by any interested person or group stating reasonable grounds for the proposed exemption, pursuant to § 1.15 of this chapter of the Commission's general procedures.
 
 § 500.5 Name and place of business of manufacturer, packer or distributor.
 (a) The label of a consumer commodity shall specify conspicuously the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor. Where the consumer commodity is not manufactured by the person whose name appears on the label, the name shall be qualified by a phrase that reveals the connection such person has with such commodity; such as “Manufactured for ___,” “Distributed by ___,” or any other wording that expresses the facts.
 (b) The requirement for declaration of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall in the case of a corporation be deemed to be satisfied only by the actual corporate name, which may be preceded or followed by the name of the particular division of the corporation. In the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under which the business is conducted shall be used.
 (c) The statement of the place of business shall include the street address, city, State, and Zip Code; however, the street address may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory.
 (d) If a person manufactures, packs, or distributes a consumer commodity at a place other than his principal place of business, the label may state the principal place of business in lieu of the actual place where such consumer commodity was manufactured or packed or is to be distributed, unless such statement would be misleading.
 (e) Standard abbreviations may be used in complying with the requirements of this section.
 
 § 500.6 Net quantity of contents declaration, location.
 (a) The label of a consumer commodity shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents separately and accurately stated on the principal display panel.
 (b) The declaration of net quantity shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel, shall be separated (by at least a space equal to the height of the lettering used in the declaration) from other printed label information appearing above or below the declaration and, shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight or mass, measure, or count such as “jumbo quart,” “giant liter,” “full gallon,” “when packed,” “minimum,” or words of similar import. The declaration of net quantity shall be separated (by at least a space equal to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the net quantity statement) from other printed label information appearing to the left or right of the declaration. However, the “e” mark shall not be considered to be a qualifying word or phrase and may be used as part of the statement of the net quantity of contents where warranted. When used, the “e” mark shall be at least 3 millimeters (approximately 1/8 in) in height. The declaration of net quantity of contents shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package or commodity rests as it is designed to be displayed: Provided, that:
 (1) On consumer commodities having a principal display panel of 5 square inches (32.2 cm2) or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of this part, and
 (2) The requirements as to separation, location, and type size, specified in this part are waived with respect to variety and combination packages as defined in this part.

§ 500.16 Measurement of container type commodities, how expressed.
 Notwithstanding other provisions of this part 500 of the regulations pertaining to the expression of net quantity of contents by measurement, commodities designed and sold at retail to be used as containers for other materials or objects, such as bags, cups, boxes, and pans, shall be labeled in accordance with the following paragraphs:
 (a) The declaration of net quantity for container commodities shall be expressed as follows:
 (1) For bag type commodities, in terms of count followed by linear dimensions of the bag (whether packaged in a perforated roll or otherwise) Net quantity of contents in terms of feet and inches shall be expressed as follows:

 (i) When the unit bag is characterized by two dimensions because of the absence of a gusset, the width and length will be expressed in inches, except that a dimension of 2 feet or more will be expressed in feet with any remainder in terms of inches or common or decimal fractions of the foot.
 
 
 (Example:
 “25 bags, 17 in. × 20 in. (43.1 × 50.8 cm)” or “200 bags, 20 in. × 2 ft. 6 in. (50.8 × 76.2 cm)”, or “50 bags, 20 in. × 21/2 ft. (50.8 × 76.2 cm)”.)
 
 

 (ii) When the unit bag is gussetted, the dimensions will be expressed as width, depth and length in terms of inches except that any dimensions of 2 feet or more will be expressed in feet with any remainder in terms of inches or the common or decimal fractions of the foot.
 
 
 (Examples:
 “25 bags, 17 in. × 4 in. × 20 in. (43 × 10 × 50 cm)”, or “200 bags, 20 in. × 12 in. × 21/2 ft. (50.8 × 30.4 × 76.2 cm)”.)
 
 

 (2) For other square, oblong, rectangular or similarly shaped containers, in terms of count followed by length, width, and depth except depth need not be listed when less than 2 inches (5.08 cm).
 
 
 (Example:
 “2 cake pans, 8 in. × 8 in. (20.3 × 20.3 cm)”, or “roasting pan, 12 in. × 8 in. × 3 in. (30.4 × 20.3 × 7.62 cm)”.)
 
 

 (3) For circular or other generally round shaped containers, except cups, and the like, in terms of count followed by diameter and depth except depth need not be listed when less than 2 inches (5.08 cm).
 
 
 (Example:
 “4 pie pans, 8 in. diameter (20.3 cm)” or “2 cake pans, 8 in. diameter × 4 in. (20.3 × 10.1 cm)”.)
 
 
 (b) When the functional use of the container is related by label reference in standard terms of measure to the capability of holding a specific quantity of substance or class of substances such references shall be a part of the net quantity statement and shall specify capacity as follows:

 (1) Liquid measure for containers which are intended to be used for liquids, semi-solids, viscous materials or mixtures of solids and liquids. The customary inch/pound statement of capacity shall be stated in terms of the largest whole U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches, quart, pint, or ounce with any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fraction of that unit.
 
 
 (Example:
 Freezer Boxes: “4 boxes, 1 qt. capacity, 6 in. × 6 in. × 4 in. (946 mL capacity, 15.2 × 15.2 × 10.1 cm)”.)
 
 

 (2) Dry measure for containers which are intended to be used for solids. The customary inch/pound statement of capacity shall be stated in terms of the largest whole U.S. bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches, peck, dry quart, or dry pint with any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fraction of that unit.
 
 
 (Example:
 Leaf Bags: “8 bags, 6 bushel capacity, 4 feet × 5 feet (211 L capacity—1.21 m × 1.52 m)”.)
 
 

 (3) Where containers are used as liners for other more permanent containers, in the same terms as are normally used to express the capacity of the more permanent container.
 
 
 (Example:
 Garbage Can Liners: “10 liners, 2 ft. 6 in. × 3 ft. 1 in., fits up to 30 gallon cans (76.2 × 93.9 cm, fits up to 113 L cans”.)
 
 

 (c) Notwithstanding the above requirements, the net quantity statement for containers such as cups will be listed in terms of count and liquid capacity per unit.
 
 
 (Example:
 “24 cups, 6 fl. oz. capacity (177 mL)”.)
 
 
 (d) For purposes of this section, the use of the terms “capacity,” “diameter,” and “fluid” is optional.","Adhesives and sealants.

(1) Has a sulfur percentage, by weight, no greater than 0.05 percent;
(2)(i) Has a cetane index of at least 40; or
(ii) Has a maximum aromatic content of 35 volume percent; and
(3) Is free of visible evidence of the dye solvent red 164; unless it is used in a manner that is tax-exempt as defined under section 4082 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 4082).
(b) Determination of compliance. (1) Any diesel fuel which does not show visible evidence of being dyed with dye solvent red 164 (which has a characteristic red color in diesel fuel) shall be considered to be available for use in diesel motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines, and shall be subject to the prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) Compliance with the sulfur, cetane, and aromatics standards in paragraph (a) of this section shall be determined based on the level of the applicable component or parameter, using the sampling methodologies specified in § 80.330(b), as applicable, and the appropriate testing methodologies specified in § 80.580(a) for sulfur, § 80.2(w) for cetane index, and § 80.2(z) for aromatic content. Any evidence or information, including the exclusive use of such evidence or information, may be used to establish the level of the applicable component or parameter in the diesel fuel, if the evidence or information is relevant to whether that level would have been in compliance with the standard if the appropriate sampling and testing methodology had been correctly performed. Such evidence may be obtained from any source or location and may include, but is not limited to, test results using methods other than the compliance methods in this paragraph (b), business records, and commercial documents.
(3) Determination of compliance with the requirements of this section other than the standards described in paragraph (a) of this section, and determination of liability for any violation of this section, may be based on information obtained from any source or location.

United States of America,World [Valid From: 25 Jun 2013],E1,Non-automatic import-licensing procedures other than authorizations covered under SPS and TBT chapters,"(a) Scope. (1) This statement addresses the policy of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on importation of chemical substances, mixtures, and articles under section 13 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA; 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). In particular, it addresses aspects of the regulation promulgated by the United States Customs Service (Customs), Department of the Treasury (19 CFR 12.118 through 12.127, and 127.28 [amended]) to implement section 13 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2612. Section 13 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse entry into the Customs territory of the United States of a chemical substance, mixture, or article if it does not comply with rules in effect under TSCA, or if it is offered for entry in violation of TSCA or rules or orders under TSCA.
 (2) In addition to this statement of policy, EPA will continue, as necessary, to address problems associated with imports in rulemaking and other actions under individual sections of TSCA, i.e., sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12. Sections 5, 6, and 7 apply directly to imports subject to the section 13 requirements. Section 12 may apply to export of a shipment that is refused entry under section 13. Importers may have obligations under sections 4 and 8; section 4 and 8 requirements for importers would not apply to individual chemical shipments and thus are not included under section 13 requirements.

 (a) Alternative standards. The imported gasoline must comply with the standards in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section as follows:
 (1) The applicable average standards, corporate average standards and per-gallon standards under § 80.195(a)(1), except that imported gasoline designated for use in the geographic phase-in area from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2006 must comply with an average standard of 150 ppm and a per-gallon standard of 300 ppm; or
 (2) In 2004, a per-gallon standard of 120 ppm, and in 2005 and subsequent years a per-gallon standard of 30 ppm, except that imported gasoline designated for use in the geographic phase-in area from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2006 must comply with a per-gallon standard of 150 ppm.
 (b) Terminal testing. The importer may use test results for sulfur content testing conducted by the terminal operator, for gasoline contained in the storage tank from which trucks used to transport gasoline into the United States are loaded, for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the standards in paragraph (a) of this section, provided the following conditions are met:
 (1) The sampling and testing shall be performed after each receipt of gasoline into the storage tank, or immediately before each transfer of gasoline to the importer's truck.
 (2) The sampling and testing shall be performed using the methods specified in § 80.330(b) and § 80.46(a)(1) or one of the alternative test methods listed in § 80.46(a)(3), respectively.
 (3) At the time of each transfer of gasoline to the importer's truck for import to the U.S., the importer must obtain a copy of the terminal test result that indicates the sulfur content of the truck load.
 (c) Quality assurance program. The importer must conduct a quality assurance program, as specified in this paragraph, for each truck loading terminal.
 (1) Quality assurance samples must be obtained from the truck-loading terminal and tested by the importer, or by an independent laboratory, and the terminal operator must not know in advance when samples are to be collected.
 (2) The sampling and testing must be performed using the methods specified in §§ 80.330(b) and 80.46(a)(1), respectively.

 (3) The quality assurance test results for sulfur must differ from the terminal test result by no more than the ASTM reproducibility of the terminal's test results, as determined by the following equation:
 
 
 R = 105× ((S+2)/104)0.4
 
 
 
 Where:
 
 R = ASTM reproducibility.
 S = Sulfur content based on the terminal's test result.
 
 
 (4) The frequency of the quality assurance sampling and testing must be at least one sample for each fifty of an importer's trucks that are loaded at a terminal, or one sample per month, whichever is more frequent.
 (d) Party required to conduct quality assurance testing. The quality assurance program under paragraph (c) of this section shall be conducted by the importer. In the alternative, this testing may be conducted by an independent laboratory that meets the criteria under § 80.65(f)(2)(iii), provided the importer receives, no later than 21 days after the sample was taken, copies of all results of tests conducted.
 (e) Assignment of batch numbers. The importer must treat each truck load of imported gasoline as a separate batch for purposes of assigning batch numbers and maintaining records under § 80.365, and reporting under § 80.370.
 (f) EPA inspections of terminals. EPA inspectors or auditors, and auditors conducting attest engagements under § 80.415, must be given full and immediate access to the truck-loading terminal and any laboratory at which samples of gasoline collected at the terminal are analyzed, and must be allowed to conduct inspections, review records, collect gasoline samples, and perform audits. These inspections or audits may be either announced or unannounced.
 (g) Certified Sulfur-FRGAS. This section does not apply to Certified Sulfur-FRGAS.
 (h) Reporting requirements. Any importer who elects to comply with the alternative standards in paragraph (a) of this section shall comply with the following requirements:
 (1) All importer recordkeeping and reporting requirements under §§ 80.365 and 80.370, except as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
 (2) An importer who elects to comply with the alternative standards in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must certify in the annual report whether it is in compliance with the applicable per-gallon batch standard set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, in lieu of providing the information required by § 80.370(a) regarding annual average sulfur content and compliance with the average standard under § 80.195.
 (i) Effect of noncompliance. If any of the requirements of this section are not met, all gasoline imported by the truck importer during the time any requirements are not met is deemed in violation of the gasoline sulfur average and per-gallon cap standards in § 80.195 or § 80.216, as applicable. Additionally, if any requirement is not met, EPA may notify the importer of the violation and, if the requirement is not fulfilled within 10 days of notification, the truck importer may not in the future use the sampling and testing provisions in this section in lieu of the provisions in § 80.330.",Gasoline,271012(Only Gasoline),Environmental Protection Agency,Title 40 - Protection of Environment; Part 80 - REGULATION OF FUELS AND FUEL ADDITIVES - Subpart H—Gasoline Sulfur,"65 FR 6823, Feb. 10, 2000",10-02-2000,,,1078553#40 CFR 80,_ - No objective specified,No objective specified

 (b) If FDA concludes that the results of the bioassays do not establish carcinogenicity, then FDA will not subject the sponsored compound to the remainder of the requirements of this subpart.
 (c) For each sponsored compound that FDA decides should be regulated as a carcinogen, FDA will either analyze the data from the bioassays using a statistical extrapolation procedure as outlined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or evaluate an alternate procedure proposed by the sponsor as provided in § 500.90. In either case, paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section apply.

 (1) For each substance tested in separate bioassays, FDA will calculate the concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern that corresponds to a maximum lifetime risk to the test animal of 1 in 1 million. FDA will designate the lowest value obtained as So. Because the total diet is not derived from food-producing animals, FDA will make corrections for food intake. FDA will designate as Sm the concentration of residue in a specific edible tissue corresponding to a maximum lifetime risk of cancer in test animals of 1 in 1 million.

 (2) From the appropriate residue chemistry data FDA will calculate the Rm as described in § 500.86(c). The sponsor must provide a regulatory method in accordance with § 500.88(b). FDA will calculate the LOD of the method from data submitted by the sponsor under § 500.88. The LOD must be less than or equal to Rm.

 § 20.4
 Definitions.
 As used in these regulations and in all instructions, forms, and documents pertaining hereto, the words and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning assigned to them as follows:
 (a) Administrator. The Administrator, Foreign Agricultural Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.
 (b) Buy-back contract. A transaction under which a reporting exporter having sold a commodity for export to a foreign buyer liquidates the export sale contract by making an offsetting purchase of the same kind of commodity from the same foreign buyer.
 (c) Commodity. Wheat and wheat flour, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, rice, cattle hides and skins, beef and pork, and any products thereof, and any other agricultural commodity the Secretary may designate. “Commodity” shall also mean a commodity having identifying characteristics as described in any announcement issued pursuant to § 20.5 such as class(es) of wheat and rice, or staple length(s) of cotton. Mixed wheat shall be considered to be the predominant wheat class of the blend. This definition excludes commodities to be used for seed which have been treated in such a manner that their use is limited to seed for planting purposes or on which a certificate has been issued by a recognized seed testing laboratory setting forth variety, germination and purity.
 (d) Country of destination. (1) Any country outside the United States or (2) any territory or possession of the United States. Country of destination shall be the ultimate destination of the export, and shall not be deemed to be the country through which any transshipment takes place.
 (e) Export. A shipment of a commodity from the United States destined to a country specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The commodity shall be deemed to have been exported on the date of the applicable export carrier onboard bill of lading or the date the commodity is received for shipment, as specified on the bill of lading, in the case of a commodity received for shipment in a lash barge or containerized van if a through on-board bill of lading is issued for shipment to a country specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
 (f) Export carrier. The vessel on which a commodity is exported from the United States to a country specified in paragraph (d) of this section, or if export is by railcar, truck, or airplane, “export carrier” means such railcar, truck, or airplane.
 (g) Exports for exporter&apos;s own account. A transaction involving shipments made by the reporting exporter which are unsold at the time of export, shipments on consignment to selling agents of the reporting exporter for subsequent sale for the account of the reporting exporter, shipments by the reporting exporter that have not been allocated to any outstanding export sale, and shipments from the United States to any foreign country in bond for subsequent shipment to a third country.
 (h) Export sale. A transaction entered into between a reporting exporter and a foreign buyer. The transaction must be represented by a written document evidencing that (1) the exporter agrees to export the commodity, (2) the foreign buyer agrees to receive the commodity, (3) a fixed price or an agreed upon mechanism by which such a price can be determined is established, and (4) payment will be made to or for the account of the reporting exporter by or on the behalf of the foreign buyer for delivery of the commodity. The quantity of “outstanding export sale” means the quantity not yet exported under an export sale. The terms of delivery specified in the written agreement, such as FAS vessel, FOB vessel, C&amp;F, CIF, etc., do not determine whether a transaction is an export sale which must be reported. A transaction which otherwise meets this definition and is subject to the posting of an exporter performance bond or letter of credit from the foreign buyer is included in this definition and such a transaction shall be reported under these regulations. However, a transaction which becomes operative only upon the imposition of export controls is excluded from this definition of “export sale” and such a transaction shall not be reported under these regulations.
 (i) Foreign buyer and foreign seller. A person whose place of doing business with respect to the transaction is outside the United States. Foreign buyer or foreign seller includes a person who maintains a place of doing business outside the United States even though the transaction is concluded in the United States by his agent who has a place of business in the United States or by his employee who does not maintain a place of doing business in the United States. (If such employee maintains a place of doing business in the United States with respect to the transaction, the resulting contract is construed to be a domestic sale.) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all foreign governments, agencies and instrumentalities are considered foreign buyers or foreign sellers even though transactions are concluded by their employees in the United States or they maintain a place of business with respect to the transaction in the United States.
 (j) Marketing year. The reporting period specified for a commodity in appendix 1.
 (k) Optional origin contracts. A transaction involving an export sale contract between a reporting exporter and a foreign buyer under which the reporting exporter has the option of exporting the commodity from the United States or from one or more other exporting countries or an export sale contract under which no origin is specified.
 (l) Person. An individual, partnership, corporation, association or other legal entity.
 (m) Purchases from foreign sellers. A transaction involving the purchase of a commodity from a seller whose place of business with respect to the transaction is outside the United States.
 (n) Quantity. The actual contract quantity (exclusive of any upward or downward tolerance) specified in the agreement between the reporting exporter and foreign buyer or seller.
 (o) Reporting exporter. A person who enters into a transaction referred to in this section whose place of doing business with respect to such transaction is in the United States. A reporting exporter shall include any person who sells a commodity to a foreign buyer irrespective of whether or not such person may appear as the shipper on the export documentation or whether or not such person is required to file a Shipper&apos;s Export Declaration. A reporting exporter would not normally include agents of either the reporting exporter or foreign buyer, brokers, or freight forwarders unless such agents, brokers or freight forwarders are acting in the capacity of a principal. (See examples § 20.6(c).)
 (p) United States. All of the 50 States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

The required form must be subsequently submitted in accordance with § 20.6(k)(2). Exporters have the option to submit the weekly reports using an electronic reporting system (forms 97e, 98e, and 100e) which may be accessed via a secured Internet website. Reporting exporters should contact the Export Sales Reporting staff to obtain passwords and access to the Internet reporting site. Exporters also have the option of satisfying the requirements of Forms FAS-97, FAS-98, and FAS-100 by submitting ASCII comma delimited files via e-mail to the ESR mailbox at esr@fas.usda.gov.
 
 (1) United States origin sales only. (i) Total quantity of outstanding export sales from the previous report by country of destination.
 (ii) Quantity of new export sales made during the week expressed in the specified unit of measure (do not include any tolerance). Include the quantity of any optional original export sale for which an option was exercised during the week to export the commodity from the United States.
 (iii) Quantity of any purchases of the same kind of commodity made from foreign sellers during the week.
 (iv) Quantity of export sales cancelled and quantity of buyback contracts made during the week.
 (v) Changes in destination during the week for export sales previously reported.
 (vi) Changes in the marketing year during the week for export sales previously reported.
 (vii) Exports made against export sales during the week.
 (viii) Total outstanding balance of export sales at the close of business for the current report.
 (2) Optional origin sales (United States and other countries). (i) Total quantity of outstanding export sales from the previous report by country of destination.
 (ii) Quantity of new export sales made during the week expressed in the specified unit of measure (do not include any tolerance) by country of destination.
 (iii) Quantity of export sales for which an option was exercised during the week which would determine the origin of the commodity to be exported with the origin indicated as the United States or other than the United States.
 (iv) Quantity of optional export sales cancelled and the quantity of optional buy-back contracts made during the week.
 (v) Changes in destination during the week for sales previously reported.
 (vi) Changes in the marketing year during the week for sales previously reported.
 (vii) Total outstanding balance of optional export sales for which an option has not been exercised at the time of compiling the report.
 (3) Exports for exporter&apos;s own account. (i) Total outstanding balance of exports for exporter&apos;s own account that has been shipped from the United States as shown on the previous report by country where located or, if in transit, by country of intermediate destination.
 (ii) Quantity of new exports for exporter&apos;s own account exported during the week.

 (v) Changes in destination during the week for exports previously reported.
 
 (vi) The total outstanding balance of exports for exporter&apos;s own account at the close of business for the current report.
 (b) Monthly reports. The information described in paragraph (a) of this section shall be reported monthly when specified by an announcement issued pursuant to § 20.5. The forms specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be utilized to furnish the information required to be reported monthly and such information shall be filed in the manner and at the time required by § 20.6(k).
 (c) Exporters who are required to report. The reporting exporter has the sole responsibility of reporting any and all information required by these regulations. The following are examples of who shall be considered the reporting exporter for the purpose of these regulations. (Firm A in each example is a firm whose place of doing business with respect to the transaction is in the United States, and the commodity to be delivered under the purchase contract is subject to these regulations. See § 20.4(i) for definition of a foreign buyer and foreign seller.)
 (1) Firm A makes an export sale to Firm B whose place of doing business with respect to the transaction is also in the United States. Firm B has made or will make an export sale to a foreign buyer. In this case Firm A cannot report the sale to Firm B since Firm B&apos;s place of doing business with respect to the transaction is located in the United States. In this example, Firm B is required to report the sale to the foreign buyer.
 (2) Firm A makes an export sale to a foreign buyer through the foreign buyer&apos;s agent and the agent&apos;s place of doing business with respect to the transaction is in the United States. In this example Firm A is required to report the export sale since the resulting contract is between Firm A and the foreign buyer.
 (3) Firm A consigns an export to his agent (other than an employee of Firm A). When the agent makes a sale to a foreign buyer, Firm A is required to report the sale. If the agent makes the sale to a firm whose place of doing business with respect to the transaction is in the United States, Firm A will not report the sale.
 (4) Firm A makes a purchase from a foreign seller. In this example, Firm A is required to report the purchase.
 (5) Firm A makes a purchase from an agent of a foreign seller and the agent&apos;s place of doing business with respect to the transaction is in the United States. In this example, Firm A is required to report the purchase. The agent is not a principal party in interest in the contract and cannot report the sale to Firm A. The foreign seller is not a reporting exporter and is not required to make a report of the sale.
 (6) Firm A, the agent of the foreign buyer, whose place of doing business with respect to the transaction is in the United States, purchases commodities domestically at interior warehouses and arranges for exportation to its principal, the foreign buyer. In this example, Firm A is required to report the sale and export.
 (7) If a reporting exporter has a transaction not described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this paragraph (c) and is in doubt whether a transaction should be reported, the exporter should request a decision from the office specified in § 20.10.
 (d) Contract terms. Reports of contract terms shall be filed when requested in accordance with § 20.11. The report showing contract terms shall be filed on FAS-99, “Contract Terms Supporting Export Sales and Foreign Purchases,” and shall include the following:
 (1) Reporting exporter&apos;s contract number.
 (2) Date of export sale or purchase.
 (3) Name of foreign buyer or foreign seller.
 (4) Delivery period specified in the export sale or purchase.
 (5) Delivery terms specified in the export sale or purchase (F.O.B., C. &amp; F., etc.).
 (6) Actual quantity of the export sale or purchase.
 (7) Quantity not exported against the sale or foreign purchase (do not include any tolerance).
 (8) Country of destination.

 (9) On purchases from foreign sellers, show separately from export sales all items of this paragraph (d).
 
 (e) Reporting of destination. The reporting exporters shall report the country of destination specified in the export sale contract or otherwise declared in writing by the foreign buyer. (Where a government, or agency of such government, is the sole importer of the commodity in a country, the exporter shall report that country as the country of destination only if the exporter or foreign buyer has made a direct sale to that foreign government or agency.) If the country of destination is not so specified or declared, the exporter shall report the destination as “unknown.” If by the time of exportation the exporter has not so ascertained the country of destination, the name of the country reported to the Bureau of Customs of the Shipper&apos;s Export Declaration for such export shipment should be reported, even though it may be an intermediate destination. The reporting exporter is not expected to report destination changes made after reporting the export on FAS-98, “Report of Export Sales and Exports.”
 (f) Optional class or kind of commodity. If the export sale provides for an option as to the class or kind of commodity to be delivered under the export sale, the reporting exporter should report the particular class or kind of commodity expected to be exported.
 (g) Range in contract quantity. If the export sale provides for a range in quantity (e.g. 10,000 metric tons to 12,000 metric tons with or without a loading tolerance) with the reporting exporter or buyer having the option to declare a firm quantity at a later date, the reporting exporter shall report the maximum export sale quantity (exclusive of any loading tolerance). If an option is exercised for a lesser quantity at a later date, the reporting exporter shall report the reduction as an amendment to an export sale previously reported.
 (h) Transfer of unexported balances from one marketing year to the next marketing year. If exports against an export sale are not complete by the end of the marketing year in which the commodity is being reported for export, the reporting exporter shall transfer the quantity not exported against the export sale to the next marketing year on the first report submitted after the beginning of the new marketing year.
 (i) Errors on previous reports. Whenever an exporter discovers an error or is advised by the office specified in § 20.10 of an error on a prior report, the error shall be corrected in the current weekly report to reflect the proper outstanding export sales and exports. The exporter shall also furnish a complete written explanation of such reporting error.
 (j) When reports are required. (1) A reporting exporter shall submit reports for those commodities for which there are new export sales, outstanding export sales, exports for exporter&apos;s own account for which an offsetting export sale has not been made and reported, or purchases from foreign sellers.
 (2) A reporting exporter may discontinue reporting for a commodity only when actual exports and other required reporting of changes have reduced to zero all export sales, exports for exporter&apos;s own account and purchases from foreign sellers. The reporting exporter shall report a zero balance prior to discontinuing reporting for the commodity involved.
 (3) If a reporting exporter discontinues making reports because a zero balance has been reached for a particular commodity, the exporter shall be responsible to commence reporting again once a new export sale, a new export for exporter&apos;s own account, or a new purchase from a foreign seller for that commodity is made.
 (k) Manner and time of reporting—(1) Manner. An original of all report forms, other than electronic forms and ASCII comma delimited files, must be filed with the office specified in § 20.10. Each report form shall contain the full business name, address and telephone number of the reporting exporter and the name and original signature of the person submitting the report form on behalf of the reporting exporter. Computer generated printouts may be used in lieu of standard reporting forms when approved by the office specified in § 20.10.
 (2) Time of filing reports. Information required to be reported weekly (either via fax, telephone, or electronically) must be received in the office specified in § 20.10 no later than 11:59 p.m. eastern time, on each Monday or such other time as may be approved in advance by that office. Such weekly report must set forth the required information as to export sales transactions made during the seven day period ending the preceding Thursday, midnight. If Friday or Monday is a national holiday, the due date shall be Tuesday. If information is transmitted by other than use of forms specified in § 20.6(a) (such as by use of telephone or electronic transmission) the required forms containing such information shall be transmitted by first class mail the next business day. It is the responsibility of the reporting exporter to arrange the most efficient and expeditious manner for the office specified in § 20.10 to receive the reported information. Information required to be reported monthly must be received in the office specified in § 20.10 no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, the fourth business day following the end of the reporting month, or such other time as may be approved in advance by that office, setting forth the required information as to export sales transactions made during the reporting month ending midnight the last day of such month.

(a) To determine the automotive fuel rating of gasoline, add the research octane number and the motor octane number and divide by two, as explained by ASTM D4814-15a, Standard Specifications for Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel, (incorporated by reference, see § 306.13). To determine the research octane and motor octane numbers, you may do one of the following:
(1) Use ASTM D2699-15a, Standard Test Method for Research Octane Number of Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel (incorporated by reference, see § 306.13), to determine the research octane number, and ASTM D2700-14, Standard Test Method for Motor Octane Number of Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel (incorporated by reference, see § 306.13), to determine the motor octane number; or
(2) Use the test method set forth in ASTM D2885-13, Standard Test Method for Determination of Octane Number of Spark-Ignition Engine Fuels by On-Line Direct Comparison Technique (incorporated by reference, see § 306.13).
(b) To determine automotive fuel ratings for alternative liquid automotive fuels other than ethanol flex fuels, biodiesel blends, and biomass-based diesel blends, you must possess a reasonable basis, consisting of competent and reliable evidence, for the percentage by volume of the principal component of the alternative liquid automotive fuel that you must disclose. In the case of biodiesel blends, you must possess a reasonable basis, consisting of competent and reliable evidence, for the percentage of biodiesel contained in the fuel. In the case of biomass-based diesel blends, you must possess a reasonable basis, consisting of competent and reliable evidence, for the percentage of biomass-based diesel contained in the fuel. In the case of ethanol flex fuels, you must possess a reasonable basis, consisting of competent and reliable evidence, for the percentage of ethanol contained in the fuel. You also must have a reasonable basis, consisting of competent and reliable evidence, for the minimum percentages by volume of other components that you choose to disclose.

The declaration must state the kind, variety, and origin of each lot of seed or screenings and the use for which the seed or screenings are being imported.
 (b) Each container of agricultural seed and vegetable seed imported into the United States for seeding (planting) purposes must be labeled to indicate the identification code or designation for the lot of seed; the name of each kind or kind and variety of agricultural seed or the name of each kind and variety of vegetable seed present in the lot in excess of 5 percent of the whole; and the designation “hybrid” when the lot contains hybrid seed. Kind and variety names used on the label shall conform to the kind and variety names used in the definitions of “agricultural seed” and “vegetable seed” in § 361.1. If any seed in the lot has been treated, each container must be further labeled, in type no smaller than 8 point, as follows:
 (1) The label must indicate that the seed has been treated and provide the name of the substance or process used to treat the seed. Substance names used on the label shall be the commonly accepted coined, chemical (generic), or abbreviated chemical name.
 (i) Commonly accepted coined names are commonly recognized as names of particular substances, e.g., thiram, captan, lindane, and dichlone.
 (ii) Examples of commonly accepted chemical (generic) names are blue-stone, calcium carbonate, cuprous oxide, zinc hydroxide, hexachlorobenzene, and ethyl mercury acetate. The terms “mercury” or “mercurial” may be used in labeling all types of mercurials.
 (iii) Examples of commonly accepted abbreviated chemical names are BHC (1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDT (dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane).

 (2) If the seed has been treated with a mercurial or similarly toxic substance harmful to humans and vertebrate animals, the label must include a representation of a skull and crossbones and a statement indicating that the seed has been treated with poison. The skull and crossbones must be at least twice the size of the type used for the information provided on the label, and the poison warning statement must be written in red letters on a background of distinctly contrasting color. Mercurials and similarly toxic substances include the following:
 
 
 Aldrin, technical
 Demeton
 Dieldrin
 p-Dimethylaminobenzenediazo sodium sulfonate
 Endrin
 Ethion
 Heptachlor

 (a) This part specifies reporting and recordkeeping procedures under section 8(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (15 U.S.C. 2607(a)) for certain manufacturers (including importers) of chemical substances. Section 8(a) of TSCA authorizes the EPA Administrator to require reporting of information necessary for administration of TSCA, including issuing regulations for the purpose of compiling and keeping current the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory (TSCA Inventory) as required by TSCA section 8(b). In accordance with TSCA section 8(b), EPA amends the TSCA Inventory to include new chemical substances manufactured (including imported) in the United States and reported under TSCA section 5(a)(1). EPA also revises the categories of chemical substances and makes other amendments as appropriate.

§ 711.5 Chemical substances for which information must be reported.
 Any chemical substance that is in the Master Inventory File at the beginning of a submission period described in § 711.20, unless the chemical substance is specifically excluded by § 711.6.

§ 711.6 Chemical substances for which information is not required.

 The following groups or categories of chemical substances are exempted from some or all of the reporting requirements of this part, with the following exception: A chemical substance described in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(4), or (b) of this section is not exempted from any of the reporting requirements of this part if that chemical substance is the subject of a rule proposed or promulgated under TSCA section 4, 5(a)(2), 5(b)(4), or 6, or is the subject of an enforceable consent agreement (ECA) developed under the procedures of 40 CFR part 790, or is the subject of an order issued under TSCA section 5(e) or 5(f), or is the subject of relief that has been granted under a civil action under TSCA section 5 or 7.
 (a) Full exemptions. The following categories of chemical substances are exempted from the reporting requirements of this part.
 (1) Polymers—(i) Any chemical substance described with the word fragments “*polym,” “*alkyd,” or “*oxylated” in the Chemical Abstracts (CA) Index Name in the Master Inventory File, where the asterisk (*) in the listed word fragments indicates that any sets of characters may precede, or follow, the character string defined.
 (ii) Any chemical substance that is identified in the Master Inventory File as an enzyme, lignin, a polysaccharide (cellulose, gum, starch), a protein (albumin, casein, gelatin, gluten, hemoglobin), rubber, siloxane and silicone, or silsesquioxane.
 (iii) This exclusion does not apply to a polymeric substance that has been depolymerized, hydrolyzed, or otherwise chemically modified, except in cases where the intended product of this reaction is totally polymeric in structure.
 (2) Microorganisms. Any combination of chemical substances that is a living organism, and that meets the definition of microorganism at 40 CFR 725.3. Any chemical substance produced from a living microorganism is reportable under this part unless otherwise excluded.
 (3) Naturally occurring chemical substances. Any naturally occurring chemical substance, as described in 40 CFR 710.4(b). The applicability of this exclusion is determined in each case by the specific activities of the person who manufactures the chemical substance in question. Some chemical substances can be manufactured both as described in 40 CFR 710.4(b) and by means other than those described in 40 CFR 710.4(b). If a person described in § 711.8 manufactures a chemical substance by means other than those described in 40 CFR 710.4(b), the person must report regardless of whether the chemical substance also could have been produced as described in 40 CFR 710.4(b). Any chemical substance that is produced from such a naturally occurring chemical substance described in 40 CFR 710.4(b) is reportable unless otherwise excluded.
 (4) Certain forms of natural gas and water. Chemical substances with the following Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN): CASRN 7732-18-5, water; CASRN 8006-14-2, natural gas; CASRN 8006-61-9, gasoline, natural; CASRN 64741-48-6, natural gas (petroleum), raw liq. mix; CASRN 68410-63-9, natural gas, dried; CASRN 68425-31-0, gasoline (natural gas), natural; and CASRN 68919-39-1, natural gas condensates.
 (b) Partial exemptions. The following groups of chemical substances are partially exempted from the reporting requirements of this part (i.e., the information described in § 711.15(b)(4) need not be reported for these chemical substances). Such chemical substances are not excluded from the other reporting requirements under this part.
 (1) Petroleum process streams. EPA has designated the chemical substances listed in Table 1 of this paragraph by CASRN, as partially exempt from reporting under the IUR.
[......]
(2) Specific exempted chemical substances—(i) Exemption. EPA has determined that, at this time, the information in § 711.15(b)(4) associated with the chemical substances listed in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section is of low current interest.
 (ii) Considerations. In making its determination of whether this partial exemption should apply to a particular chemical substance, EPA will consider the totality of information available for the chemical substance in question, including but not limited to, one or more of the following considerations:
 (A) Whether the chemical substance qualifies or has qualified in past IUR collections for the reporting of the information described in § 711.15(b)(4).
 (B) The chemical substance&apos;s chemical and physical properties or potential for persistence, bioaccumulation, health effects, or environmental effects (considered independently or together).

For the submission periods subsequent to the 2012 submission period, any person who must report under this part, as described in § 711.8, must submit the information described in this section for each chemical substance described in § 711.5 that the person manufactured (including imported) for commercial purposes in an amount of 25,000 lb (11,340 kg) or more (or in an amount of 2,500 lb (1,134 kg) or more for chemical substances subject to the rules, orders, or actions described in § 711.8(b)) at any one site during any calendar year since the last principal reporting year (e.g., for the 2016 submission period, consider calendar years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, because 2011 was the last principal reporting year). The principal reporting year for each submission period is the previous calendar year (e.g., the principal reporting year for the 2016 submission period is calendar year 2015). For all submission periods, a separate report must be submitted for each chemical substance at each site for which the submitter is required to report. A submitter of information under this part must report information as described in this section to the extent that such information is known to or reasonably ascertainable by that person.
 (a) Reporting information to EPA. Any person who reports information to EPA must do so using the e-CDRweb reporting tool provided by EPA at the address set forth in § 711.35. The submission must include all information described in paragraph (b) of this section. Persons must submit a separate Form U for each site for which the person is required to report. The e-CDRweb reporting tool is described in the instructions available from EPA at the Web site set forth in § 711.35.
 (b) Information to be reported. For the 2012 submission period, manufacturers (including importers) of a reportable chemical substance in an amount of 25,000 lb (11,340 kg) or more at a site during the principal reporting year (i.e., 2011) must report the information described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section. For the 2012 submission period, manufacturers (including importers) of a reportable chemical substance in an amount of 100,000 lb (45,359 kg) or more at a site during the principal reporting year (i.e., 2011) must additionally report the information described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. For submission periods subsequent to the 2012 submission period, the information described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section must be reported for each chemical substance manufactured (including imported) in an amount of 25,000 lb (11,340 kg) or more (or in an amount of 2,500 lb (1,134 kg) or more for chemical substances subject to the rules, orders, or actions described in § 711.8(b)) at any one site during any calendar year since the last principal reporting year. The requirement to report information described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section is subject to exemption as described in § 711.6.
 (1) A certification statement signed and dated by an authorized official of the submitter company. The authorized official must certify that the submitted information has been completed in compliance with the requirements of this part and that the confidentiality claims made on the Form U are true and correct. The certification must be signed and dated by the authorized official for the submitter company, and provide that person&apos;s name, official title, and e-mail address.
 (2) Company and plant site information. The following currently correct company and plant site information must be reported for each site at which a reportable chemical substance is manufactured (including imported) above the applicable production volume threshold, as described in this section (see § 711.3 for the “site” for importers):
 (i) The U.S. parent company name, address, and Dun and Bradstreet D-U-N-S ® (D&amp;B) number. A submitter under this part must obtain a D&amp;B number for the U.S. parent company if none exists.
 (ii) The name of a person who will serve as technical contact for the submitter company, and who will be able to answer questions about the information submitted by the company to EPA, the contact person&apos;s full mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address.
 (iii) The name and full street address of each site. A submitter under this part must include the appropriate D&amp;B number for each plant site reported, and the county or parish (or other jurisdictional indicator) in which the plant site is located. A submitter under this part must obtain a D&amp;B number for the site reported if none exists.
 (3) Chemical-specific information. The following chemical-specific information must be reported for each reportable chemical substance manufactured (including imported) above the applicable production volume threshold, as described in paragraph (b) of this section:

 (i) The specific, currently correct CA Index name as used to list the chemical substance on the TSCA Inventory and the correct corresponding CASRN for each reportable chemical substance at each site. A submitter under this part may use an EPA-designated TSCA Accession Number for a chemical substance in lieu of a CASRN when a CASRN is not known to or reasonably ascertainable by the submitter. Submitters who wish to report chemical substances listed on the confidential portion of the TSCA Inventory will need to report the chemical substance using a TSCA Accession Number.
 In addition to reporting the number itself, submitters must specify the type of number they are reporting by selecting from among the codes in Table 3 of this paragraph.
[.....]

§ 711.20 When to report.
 All information reported to EPA in response to the requirements of this part must be submitted during an applicable submission period. The 2012 CDR submission period is from February 1, 2012 to August 13, 2012. Subsequent recurring submission periods are from June 1 to September 30 at 4-year intervals, beginning in 2016. In each submission period, any person described in § 711.8 must report as described in this part.

§ 711.22 Duplicative reporting.
 (a) With regard to TSCA section 8(a) rules. Any person subject to the requirements of this part who previously has complied with reporting requirements of a rule under TSCA section 8(a) by submitting the information described in § 711.15 for a chemical substance described in § 711.5 to EPA, and has done so within 1 year of the start of a submission period described in § 711.20, is not required to report again on the manufacture of that chemical substance at that site during that submission period.
 (b) With regard to importers. This part requires that only one report be submitted on each import transaction involving a chemical substance described in § 711.5. When two or more persons are involved in a particular import transaction and each person meets the Agency&apos;s definition of “importer” as set forth in 40 CFR 704.3, they may determine among themselves who should submit the required report; if no report is submitted as required under this part, EPA will hold each such person liable for failure to report.
 (c) Toll manufacturers and persons contracting with a toll manufacturer. This part requires that only one report per site be submitted on each chemical substance described in § 711.5. When a company contracts with a toll manufacturer to manufacture a chemical substance, and each party meets the Agency&apos;s definition of “manufacturer” as set forth in § 711.3, they may determine among themselves who should submit the required report for that site. However, both the contracting company and the toll manufacturer are liable if no report is made.

§ 711.25 Recordkeeping requirements.
 Each person who is subject to the reporting requirements of this part must retain records that document any information reported to EPA. Records relevant to reporting during a submission period must be retained for a period of 5 years beginning on the last day of the submission period. Submitters are encouraged to retain their records longer than 5 years to ensure that past records are available as a reference when new submissions are being generated.

United States of America,World [Valid From: 18 Apr 2003],B22,Restricted use of certain substances,"(a) Under the authority of section 2(q)(1)(B) of the act, the Commission declares as banned hazardous substances the following articles because they possess such a degree or nature of hazard that adequate cautionary labeling cannot be written and the public health and safety can be served only by keeping such articles out of interstate commerce:
 (3) Fireworks devices intended to produce audible effects (including but not limited to cherry bombs, M-80 salutes, silver salutes, and other large firecrackers, aerial bombs, and other fireworks designed to produce audible effects, and including kits and components intended to produce such fireworks) if the audible effect is produced by a charge of more than 2 grains of pyrotechnic composition; except that this provision shall not apply to such fireworks devices if all of the following conditions are met:
 (i) Such fireworks devices are distributed to farmers, ranchers, or growers through a wildlife management program administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior (or by equivalent State or local government agencies); and
 (ii) Such distribution is in response to a written application describing the wildlife management problem that requires use of such devices, is of a quantity no greater than required to control the problem described, and is where other means of control are unavailable or inadequate. (See also § 1500.14(b)(7); § 1500.17(a) (8) and (9); § 1500.83(a)(27); § 1500.85(a)(2); and part 1507).
 (4) Liquid drain cleaners containing 10 percent or more by weight of sodium and/or potassium hydroxide; except that this subparagraph shall not apply to such liquid drain cleaners if packaged in accordance with a standard for special packaging of such articles promulgated under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-601, 84 Stat. 1670-74 (15 U.S.C. 1471-76)).
 (5) Products containing soluble cyanide salts, excluding unavoidable manufacturing residues of cyanide salts in other chemicals that under reasonable and foreseeable conditions of use will not result in a concentration of cyanide greater than 25 parts per million.
 (6)(i) Any paint or other similar surface-coating material intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in or around the household that:
 (A) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1973, and contains lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.06 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film; or
 (B) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1972, and contains lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.5 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film.
 (C) [Reserved]
 (D) The provisions of paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section do not apply to artists' paints and related materials.
 (ii) Any toy or other article intended for use by children that:
 (A) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1973, and bears any paint or other similar surface-coating material containing lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.06 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film; or
 (B) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1972, and bears any paint or other similar surface-coating material containing lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.5 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film.
 (iii) Since the Commission has issued comprehensive regulations for lead-containing paint and certain consumer products bearing such paint at the 0.06 percent level under the Consumer Product Safety Act (see 16 CFR part 1303), paragraphs (i) and (ii) of § 1500.17(a)(6) are revoked as to the subject products manufactured after February 27, 1978.
 Note:
 The effective date of paragraphs (a)(6)(i)(A) and (a)(6)(ii)(A) was stayed by an order published in the Federal Register of August 10, 1972 (37 FR 16078).
 (8) Firecrackers designed to produce audible effects, if the audible effect is produced by a charge of more than 50 milligrams (.772 grains) of pyrotechnic composition (not including firecrackers included as components of a rocket), aerial bombs, and devices that may be confused with candy or other foods, such as “dragon eggs,” and “cracker balls” (also known as “ball-type caps”), and including kits and components intended to produce such fireworks except such devices which meet all of the following conditions:
 (i) The fireworks devices are distributed to farmers, ranchers, or growers through a wildlife management program administered by the U.S. Department of Interior (or by equivalent State or local governmental agencies); and
 (ii) Such distribution is in response to a written application describing the wildlife management problem that requires use of such devices, is of a quantity no greater than required to control the problem described, and is where other means of control is unavailable or inadequate. (See also § 1500.17(a) (3) and (9)).
 (11)(i) Reloadable tube aerial shell fireworks devices that use shells larger than 1.75 inches in outer diameter and that are imported on or after October 8, 1991.
 (ii) Findings. (A) General. In order to issue a rule under section 2(q)(1) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (“FHSA”), 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1), classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the FHSA requires the Commission to make certain findings and to include these findings in the regulation. These findings are discussed below.
 (B) Voluntary standard. Although a voluntary standard relating to the risk of injury associated with reloadable tube aerial shells has been adopted, it has not been implemented. Thus, the Commission is not required to make findings covering the likelihood that the voluntary standard would result in elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury or that there would be substantial compliance with the voluntary standard.
 (C) Relationship of benefits to costs. The Commission estimates that the removal of large reloadable shells from the market is likely to virtually eliminate the number of associated injuries, with only a slight offsetting increase in the number of injuries due to the use of substitute Class C fireworks products available to consumers. The estimated net benefits range from essentially zero to close to $1 million annually. The annual costs of a ban are estimated to be very low. Included are potential costs to foreign manufacturers and U.S. importers from sales losses, production changes, and inventory retrofitting, and slightly reduced market choices for consumers who purchase aerial display fireworks. Costs to each of these sectors are estimated to be slight, and are reduced to the extent that alternative products are perceived as adequate substitutes for large reloadable shells. Thus, the Commission finds that the benefits expected from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.
 (D) Least burdensome requirement. The Commission considered several alternatives to the ban. These included: Design or performance criteria; additional or alternative labeling; inclusion of some reloadable shells 1.75 inches or smaller in the ban; and no action in reliance on the voluntary standard. The Commission determined that a ban of reloadable shells larger than 1.75 inches in outer diameter is the least burdensome alternative that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of injury.
 (1) Regarding design or performance criteria, the Commission considered requirements similar to those stated in the voluntary standard of the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory (“AFSL”). However, such criteria may increase the cost of the product and would not address all factors involved in the incidents. Further, concerns exist about the feasibility of criteria and quality control.
 (2) Regarding additional or alternative labeling, the users' perception and experience concerning the amount of time available to get away may lead them to disregard an inconsistent warning. There are no data to suggest that a significant number, if any, incidents would be avoided if large reloadable shells carried more detailed labels or instructions than they currently do. It cannot be concluded that potential benefits would be greater than zero.
 (3) The Commission considered including reloadable shells that are 1.75 inches or less in outer diameter and have the “equivalent explosive power” of larger shells. A kinetic energy level of 70 joules was considered to evaluate explosive power. However, any potential benefits are uncertain since the Commission concluded that a clear relation between kinetic energy and injury potential could not be established. Also, costs could be slightly higher.
 (4) The Commission also considered imposing no mandatory requirements on large reloadable shells and relying instead on the AFSL voluntary standard. However, it is uncertain whether any net benefits to consumers would result from this alternative, since the level of injury reduction could be near zero if, as is probable, some firms chose not to conform with some or all of the AFSL standard.
 (13)(i) Candles made with metal-cored wicks. Candles manufactured or imported on or after October 15, 2003, made with metal-cored candlewicks, unless:
 (A) The metal core of each candlewick has a lead content (calculated as the metal) of not more than 0.06 percent of the total weight of the metal core; and
 (B) Each outer container or wrapper in which candles subject to paragraph (a)(13)(i)(A) of this section are shipped, including each outer container or wrapper in which such candles are distributed to a retail outlet, is labeled “Conforms to 16 CFR 1500.17(a)(13).” For purposes of this paragraph (B), the term “outer container or wrapper” does not include the immediate container in which candle(s) is/are intended to be displayed at retail or during use in the home, unless that container or wrapper is also the only container or wrapper in which the candle(s) is/are shipped to a retailer.
 (ii) Metal-cored candlewicks. Metal-cored candlewicks manufactured or imported on or after October 15, 2003, unless:
 (A) The metal core of each candlewick has a lead content (calculated as the metal) of not more than 0.06 percent of the total weight of the metal core; and
 (B) Each outer container or wrapper in which candlewicks subject to paragraph (a)(13)(ii)(A) of this section is shipped, including each outer container or wrapper of a shipment distributed to a retail outlet, is labeled “Conforms to 16 CFR 1500.17(a)(13).” For purposes of this paragraph (B), the term “outer container or wrapper” does not include the immediate container in which candlewick(s) is/are intended to be displayed or sold at retail, unless that container or wrapper is also the only container or wrapper in which the candlewick(s) is/are shipped to a retailer.
 (iii) Findings—(A) General. To issue a rule under section 2(q)(1) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1), classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the Commission must make certain findings and include them in the regulation. These findings are discussed in paragraphs (a)(13)(iii)(B) through (D) of this section.
 (B) Voluntary Standard. One alternative to the ban that the Commission considered is to take no mandatory action, and to depend on a voluntary standard. One organization has a standard for candlewicks intended to address the potential for substantial illness posed by such wicks and candles with such wicks. The Commission has found that the standard is technically unsound and that substantial compliance with it is unlikely. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the standard has been adopted and implemented by candlewick or candle manufacturers.
 (C) Relationship of Benefits to Costs. The Commission estimates that the ban will reduce the potential for exposure to lead and resulting lead poisoning because there is no “safe” level of lead in the blood. The annual cost to the candle/wick industry of the ban is estimated by the Commission to be in the range of $100,000 to $300,000. On a percentage basis these costs represent only 0.005 to 0.015 percent of the overall value of candle shipments in 2000, which was approximately $2 billion. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the benefits from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.
 (D) Least burdensome requirement. The Commission considered the following alternatives: no action; labeling all metal-cored candles with wicks containing more than 0.06 percent lead by weight of the metal; recordkeeping for shipments of wicks containing 0.06 percent or less lead by weight of the metal and of candles with such wicks; and relying on the voluntary standard. Neither no action, nor labeling, nor reliance on the voluntary standard would adequately reduce the risk of illness. Recordkeeping for shipments of wicks and of candles was not the least burdensome requirement that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of illness. Therefore the Commission finds that a ban on candlewicks containing more than 0.06 percent lead by weight of the metal and candles with such wicks is the least burdensome requirement that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of illness.","1) Fireworks devices intended to produce audible effects (including but not limited to cherry bombs, M-80 salutes, silver salutes, and other large firecrackers, aerial bombs, and other fireworks designed to produce audible effects, and including kits and components intended to produce such fireworks);

(c) Nothing in this part shall restrict the importation and transportation of dead salmonid fish when such fish have been eviscerated (all internal organs removed, gills may remain) or filleted or when such fish or eggs have been processed by canning, pickling, smoking, or otherwise prepared in a manner whereby the Oncorhynchus masou virus and the viruses causing viral hemorrhagic septicemia, infectious hematopoietic necrosis, and infectious pancreatic necrosis have been killed.
(d) Any fish caught in the wild in North America under a valid sport or commercial fishing license shall be exempt from sampling and certification requirements and from filing the Declaration for Importation of Wildlife. The Director may enter into formal agreements allowing the importation of gametes, fertilized eggs, live fish, or dead, uneviscerated fish without inspection and certification of pathogen status, if the exporting Nation has an acceptable program of inspection and pathogen control in operation, can document the occurrence and distribution of fish pathogens within its boundaries, and can demonstrate that importation of salmonid fishes into the United States from that National will not pose a substantial risk to the public and private fish stocks of the United States.
(e) Fish sampling requirements, sample processing, and methods for virus assays—(1) Fish sampling requirements. (i) Sampling for virus assays required by this section must be conducted within the six (6) months prior to the date of shipment of dead uneviscerated salmonid fish, live salmonid fish, live salmonid eggs, or salmonid gametes to the United States. Sampling shall be on a lot-by-lot basis with the samples from each lot distinctively marked, maintained, and processed for virus assay separately. A fish lot is defined as a group of fish of the same species and age that originated from the same discrete spawning population and that always have shared a common water supply. In the case of adult broodstock, various age groups of the same fish species may be sampled as a single lot, provided they meet the other conditions previously stated and have shared the same container(s) for at least 1 year prior to the sampling date.
(ii) In a sample, or sub-sample of a given lot, collection of 10 or more moribund fish shall be given first preference. The remainder of fish required for collection shall be randomly selected live fish from all containers occupied by the lot being sampled. Moribund fish shall be collected and processed separately from randomly selected fish. In the event the sample is taken from adult broodstock of different ages that share the same container, first preference shall be given to collecting samples from the older fish.
(iii) The minimum sample numbers collected from each lot must be in accordance with a plan that provides 95 percent confidence that at least one fish, with a detectable level of infection, will be collected and will be present in the sample if the assumed minimum prevalence of infection equals or exceeds 2 percent. A total of 150 fish collected proportionately from among all containers shared by the lot usually meets this requirement. A sampling strategy based on a presumed pathogen prevalence of 5 percent (60 fish) may be used to meet sampling requirements for shipments of gametes, fertilized eggs, or uneviscerated dead fish; provided that in the previous 2 years no disease outbreaks caused by a pathogen of concern have occurred at the facility from which the shipment originated and all stocks held at the facility have been inspected at least four times during that period (at intervals of approximately 6 months) and no pathogens of concern detected.
(iv) Fish must be alive when collected and processed within 48 hours after collection. Tissue and fluid samples shall be stored in sealed, aseptic containers and kept at 4 °Celsius (C.) or on ice but not frozen.
(v) Tissue collection shall be as follows:
(A) Sac Fry and fry to 4 centimeter (cm): Assay entire fish. If present, remove the yolk sac.
(B) Fish 4-6 cm: Assay entire visceral mass including kidney.
(C) Fish longer than 6 cm: Assay kidney and spleen in approximately equal weight proportions.
(D) Spawning adult broodstock: Assay kidney and spleen tissues from males and/or females and ovarian fluid from females. Ovarian fluid may comprise up to 50 percent of the samples collected.
(2) General sample processing requirements. (i) Ovarian fluid samples shall be collected from each spawning female separately. All samples from individual fish shall be measured to ensure that similar quantities from each fish are combined if samples are pooled. Ovarian fluid samples from no more than five fish may be combined to form a pool.
(ii) Whole fry (less yolk sacs), viscera, and kidney and spleen tissues from no more than five fish may be similarly pooled.
(iii) Antibiotics and antifungal agents may be added to ovarian fluid or tissue samples to control microbial contaminant growth at the time of sample collection. Final concentrations shall not exceed 200-500 micrograms/milliliter (µg/ml) of Gentamycin, 800 international units/milliliter (IU/ml) of penicillin, or 800 µg/ml of streptomycin. Antifungal agent concentrations should not exceed 200 IU/ml of mycostatin (Nystatin) of 20 µg/ml of amphotericin B (Fungizone).
(iv) Sample temperature must be maintained between 4 at 15 °C. during processing. Use separate sets of sterile homogenization and processing equipment to process fluids or tissues from each fish lot sampled. Processing equipment need not be sterilized between samples within a single lot.
(v) Homogenized tissue samples may be diluted 1:10 with buffered cell culture medium (pH 7.4-7.8) containing antibiotics and antifungal agents not exceeding the concentrations described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.

§ 16.22
 Injurious wildlife permits.
 The Director may, upon receipt of an application and in accordance with the issuance criteria of this section, issue a permit authorizing the importation into or shipment between the continental United States, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any possession of the United States of injurious wildlife (See subpart B of this part) for zoological, educational, medical, or scientific purposes.
 (a) Application requirements. Submit applications for permits to import, transport, or acquire injurious wildlife for such purposes to the attention of the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at the address listed for the Division of Management Authority at 50 CFR 2.1(b). Submit applications in writing on a Federal Fish and Wildlife License/Permit application (Form 3-200) and attach all of the following information:
 (1) The number of specimens and the common and scientific names (genus and species) of each species of live wildlife proposed to be imported or otherwise acquired, transported and possessed;
 (2) The purpose of such importation or other acquisition, transportation and possession;
 (3) The address of the premises where such live wildlife will be kept in captivity;
 (4) A statement of the applicant's qualifications and previous experience in caring for and handling captive wildlife.
 (b) Additional permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter B, permits to import or ship injurious wildlife for zoological, educational, medical, or scientific purposes shall be subject to the following conditions:
 
 (1) All live wildlife acquired under permit and all progeny thereof, must be confined in the approved facilities on the premises authorized in the permit.
 (2) No live wildlife, acquired under permit, or any eggs or progeny thereof, may be sold, donated, traded, loaned, or transferred to any other person unless such person has a permit issued by the Director under § 16.22 authorizing him to acquire and possess such wildlife or the eggs or progeny thereof.
 (3) Permittees shall notify the nearest Special Agent-in-Charge (see § 10.22 of this chapter) by telephone or other expedient means within 24 hours following the escape of any wildlife imported or transported under authority of a permit issued under this section, or the escape of any progeny of such wildlife, unless otherwise specifically exempted by terms of the permit.
 (c) Issuance criteria. The Director shall consider the following in determining whether to issue a permit to import or ship injurious wildlife for zoological, educational, medical, or scientific purposes:
 (1) Whether the wildlife is being imported or otherwise acquired for a bona fide scientific, medical, educational, or zoological exhibition purpose;
 (2) Whether the facilities for holding the wildlife in captivity have been inspected and approved, and consist of a basic cage or structure of a design and material adequate to prevent escape which is maintained inside a building or other facility of such structure that the wildlife could not escape from the building or other facility after escaping from the cage or structure maintained therein;
 (3) Whether the applicant is a responsible person who is aware of the potential dangers to public interests posed by such wildlife, and who by reason of his knowledge, experience, and facilities reasonably can be expected to provide adequate protection for such public interests; and
 (4) If such wildlife is to be imported or otherwise acquired for zoological or aquarium exhibition purposes, whether such exhibition or display will be open to the public during regular appropriate hours.
 (d) The Office of Management and Budget approved the information collection requirements contained in this part 16 under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned OMB Control Number 1018-0093. The Service may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. We are collecting this information to provide information necessary to evaluate permit applications. We will use this information to review permit applications and make decisions, according to criteria established in various Federal wildlife conservation statutes and regulations, on the issuance, suspension, revocation, or denial of permits. You must respond to obtain or retain a permit. We estimate the public reporting burden for these reporting requirements to average 2 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and reviewing the forms. Direct comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of these reporting requirements to the Service's Information Collection Clearance Officer at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).

 (ii) All required label text must:
 (A) Be set in 6-point or larger type;
 (B) Appear on a clear contrasting background; and
 (C) Not be obscured or crowded.
 (3) Language to be used. All required label or labeling text shall appear in the English language. However, the Agency may require or the applicant may propose additional text in other languages as is considered necessary to protect the public. When additional text in another language is necessary, all labeling requirements will be applied equally to both the English and other-language versions of the labeling.
 (4) Placement of Label—(i) General. The label shall appear on or be securely attached to the immediate container of the pesticide product. For purposes of this section, and the misbranding provisions of the Act, “securely attached” shall mean that a label can reasonably be expected to remain affixed during the foreseeable conditions and period of use. If the immediate container is enclosed within a wrapper or outside container through which the label cannot be clearly read, the label must also be securely attached to such outside wrapper or container, if it is a part of the package as customarily distributed or sold.
 (ii) Tank cars and other bulk containers—(A) Transportation. While a pesticide product is in transit, the appropriate provisions of 49 CFR parts 170-189, concerning the transportation of hazardous materials, and specifically those provisions concerning the labeling, marking and placarding of hazardous materials and the vehicles carrying them, define the basic Federal requirements. In addition, when any registered pesticide product is transported in a tank car, tank truck or other mobile or portable bulk container, a copy of the accepted label must be attached to the shipping papers, and left with the consignee at the time of delivery.
 (B) Storage. When pesticide products are stored in bulk containers, whether mobile or stationary, which remain in the custody of the user, a copy of the label of labeling, including all appropriate directions for use, shall be securely attached to the container in the immediate vicinity of the discharge control valve.
 (5) False or misleading statements. Pursuant to section 2(q)(1)(A) of the Act, a pesticide or a device declared subject to the Act pursuant to § 152.500, is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular including both pesticidal and non-pesticidal claims. Examples of statements or representations in the labeling which constitute misbranding include:
 (i) A false or misleading statement concerning the composition of the product;
 (ii) A false or misleading statement concerning the effectiveness of the product as a pesticide or device;
 (iii) A false or misleading statement about the value of the product for purposes other than as a pesticide or device;
 (iv) A false or misleading comparison with other pesticides or devices;
 (v) Any statement directly or indirectly implying that the pesticide or device is recommended or endorsed by any agency of the Federal Government;
 (vi) The name of a pesticide which contains two or more principal active ingredients if the name suggests one or more but not all such principal active ingredients even though the names of the other ingredients are stated elsewhere in the labeling;
 (vii) A true statement used in such a way as to give a false or misleading impression to the purchaser;
 (viii) Label disclaimers which negate or detract from labeling statements required under the Act and these regulations;
 (ix) Claims as to the safety of the pesticide or its ingredients, including statements such as “safe,” “nonpoisonous,” “noninjurious,” “harmless” or “nontoxic to humans and pets” with or without such a qualifying phrase as “when used as directed”; and

In addition to the license requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR, you may not export, reexport or transfer (in-country) microprocessors (“microprocessor microcircuits,” “microcomputer microcircuits,” and microcontroller microcircuits having a processing speed of 5 GFLOPS or more and an arithmetic logic unit with an access width of 32 bit or more, including those incorporating “information security” functionality), or associated “software” and “technology” for the “production” or “development” of such microprocessors without a license if, at the time of the export, reexport or transfer (in-country), you know, have reason to know, or are informed by BIS that the item will be or is intended to be used for a 'military end use,' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, in a destination listed in Country Group D:1 (see supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or by a 'military end user,' as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, in a destination listed in Country Group D:1.
(b) Additional prohibition on exporters or reexporters informed by BIS. BIS may inform an exporter, reexporter or transferor, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for export, reexport or transfer (in-country) of items described in paragraph (a) of this section to specified end users, because BIS has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to the end uses or end users described in paragraph (a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. The absence of any such notification does not excuse the exporter, reexporter or transferor from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) License review standards. There is a presumption of denial for applications to export, reexport or transfer (in-country) items subject to this section.
(d) Military end-use. In this section, the phrase `military end use' means incorporation into: a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) (22 CFR part 121, International Traffic in Arms Regulations) or the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement Web site at http://www.wassenaar.org); commodities classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs; or any commodity that is designed for the “use,” “development,” “production,” or deployment of military items described on the USML, the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List or classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs. supplement No. 1 of this part lists examples of 'military end use.'

 S6.1Equilibrium reflux boiling point. Determine the ERBP of a brake fluid by running duplicate samples according to the following procedure and averaging the results.
 S6.1.1Summary of procedure. Sixty milliliters (ml.) of brake fluid are boiled under specified equilibrium conditions (reflux) at atmospheric pressure in a 100-ml. flask. The average temperature of the boiling fluid at the end of the reflux period, corrected for variations in barometric pressure if necessary, is the ERBP.
 S6.1.2Apparatus. (See Figure 1) The test apparatus shall consist of—
 (a) Flask. (See Figure 2) A 100-ml. round-bottom, short-neck heat-resistant glass flask having a neck with a 19/38 standard taper, female ground-glass joint and a side-entering tube, with an outside diameter of 10 millimeters (mm.), which centers the thermometer bulb in the flask 6.5 mm. from the bottom;
 (b) Condenser. A water-cooled, reflux, glass-tube type, condenser having a jacket 200 mm. in length, the bottom end of which has a 19/38 standard-taper, drip-tip, male ground-glass joint;
 (c) Boiling stones. Three clean, unused silicon carbide grains (approximately 2 mm. (0.08 inch) in diameter, grit No. 8);
 (d) Thermometer. Standardized calibrated partial immersion (76 mm.), solid stem, thermometers conforming to the requirements for an ASTM 2C or 2F, and an ASTM 3C or 3F thermometer; and
 (e) Heat source. Variable autotransformer-controlled heating mantle designed to fit the flask, or an electric heater with rheostat heat control.

 S6.1.3Preparation of apparatus. (a) Thoroughly clean and dry all glassware.
 (b) Insert thermometer through the side tube until the tip of the bulb is 6.5 mm. (1/4 inch) from the bottom center of the flask. Seal with a short piece of natural rubber, EPDM, SBR, or butyl tubing.
 (c) Place 60 ±1 ml. of brake fluid and the silicon carbide grains into the flask.
 (d) Attach the flask to the condenser. When using a heating mantle, place the mantle under the flask and support it with a ring-clamp and laboratory-type stand, holding the entire assembly in place by a clamp. When using a rheostat-controlled heater, center a standard porcelain or hard asbestos refractory, having a diameter opening 32 to 38 mm., over the heating element and mount the flask so that direct heat is applied only through the opening in the refractory. Place the assembly in an area free from drafts or other types of sudden temperature changes. Connect the cooling water inlet and outlet tubes to the condenser. Turn on the cooling water. The water supply temperature shall not exceed 28 °C. (82.4 °F.) and the temperature rise through the condenser shall not exceed 2 °C. (3.6 °F.).
 S6.1.4Procedure. Apply heat to the flask so that within 10 ±2 minutes the fluid is refluxing in excess of 1 drop per second. The reflux rate shall not exceed 5 drops per second at any time. Immediately adjust the heating rate to obtain an equilibrium reflux rate of 1 to 2 drops per second over the next 5 ±2 minutes. Maintain this rate for an additional 2 minutes, taking four temperature readings at 30-second intervals. Record the average of these as the observed ERBP. If no reflux is evident when the fluid temperature reaches 260 °C (500 °F), discontinue heating and report ERBP as in excess of 260 °C (500 °F).
 S6.1.5Calculation. (a) Thermometer inaccuracy. Correct the observed ERBP by applying any correction factor obtained in standardizing the thermometer.
 (b) Variation from standard barometric pressure. Apply the factor shown in Table III to calculate the barometric pressure correction to the ERBP.
