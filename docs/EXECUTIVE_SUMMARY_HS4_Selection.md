## ⚠️ WHAT NOT TO DO

### **❌ DON'T use all 1,230 HS codes**
**Why**: 
- Thesis becomes data processing exercise, not AI research
- Can't do meaningful NTM research for 1,230 products
- Committee will ask "why spread so thin?"
- Obscures your key findings

### **❌ DON'T select fewer than 8 codes**
**Why**:
- May appear too narrow/cherry-picked
- Harder to demonstrate generalizability
- Limits diversity of case studies
- Weak statistical foundation

### **❌ DON'T ignore agricultural/commodity products**
**Why**:
- NTMs are MOST complex in agriculture (SPS, TBT)
- India's competitive advantages are strongest here
- Demonstrates framework versatility beyond tech

### **❌ DON'T select only high-value or only high-risk products**
**Why**:
- Need mix of risk levels for validation
- Control groups essential for credibility
- Committees want to see balanced judgment

## 🎓 THESIS DEFENSE TALKING POINTS

### **When Asked: "Why Only 10-12 Products?"**

**Your Answer**:
> "This research prioritizes analytical depth over breadth. The 10 selected HS4 codes span technology, agriculture, minerals, and manufacturing sectors, representing $44 billion in quarterly trade. This portfolio demonstrates the framework's applicability across diverse risk profiles while enabling rigorous NTM analysis and detailed retrospective validation that would be impossible with 1,230 products. The modular architecture is designed for scalability to the full HS universe in production deployment."

### **When Asked: "How Did You Select These Products?"**

**Your Answer**:
> "Selection criteria included: (1) significant bilateral trade volumes (>$20M/quarter), (2) documented geopolitical sensitivity or NTM complexity, (3) representation across key HS chapters, (4) availability of historical policy changes for retrospective validation, and (5) strategic importance to US-China-India trade relations. The portfolio intentionally includes high-risk products (semiconductors, graphite), successful diversification examples (shrimp, textiles), and stable controls (kitchenware) to validate the system's discriminative capacity."

### **When Asked: "What About Other Products?"**

**Your Answer**:
> "The Framework Design section explicitly addresses scalability. The data pipeline and Agentic AI architecture are product-agnostic. Future work includes expanding to additional HS chapters, particularly chemicals (HS 28-38), machinery (HS 84-85), and transport equipment (HS 86-89). The current selection provides sufficient diversity to validate methodology while remaining feasible within the 4-month research timeline."

## 📝 UPDATED THESIS SCOPE SECTION (DRAFT)

**For Your Proposal:**

> **6.2 Product Granularity**
>
> Analysis will be conducted at the HS 4-digit level for **10-12 strategically selected products** representing four key categories:
>
> **Technology Products (4 codes):** Telecommunications equipment (HS 8517), computing machines (HS 8471), electric batteries (HS 8507), and semiconductors (HS 8542). These products represent the core of US-China technology competition, supply chain security concerns, and policy interventions including Section 301 tariffs, CHIPS Act incentives, and export controls.
>
> **Agricultural & Food Products (2-3 codes):** Vegetable extracts/herbal preparations (HS 1302) and crustaceans (HS 0306), supplemented by rice (HS 1006) if scope permits. These products demonstrate India's competitive advantages in agricultural commodities and the complexity of sanitary/phytosanitary (SPS) and technical barriers to trade (TBT) measures.
>
> **Critical Minerals (1 code):** Natural graphite (HS 2504), representing extreme geopolitical concentration risk in minerals essential to electric vehicle batteries and semiconductors, with recent Chinese export control implications.
>
> **Manufacturing Diversification Examples (2-3 codes):** Bedlinen (HS 6302), toys (HS 9503), and plastic kitchenware (HS 3924 - baseline control). These illustrate successful and ongoing "China+1" supply chain reconfigurations driven by tariff and non-tariff measures.
>
> This portfolio spans high-value technology products ($5-17 billion per quarter), strategic agricultural commodities ($100-536 million per quarter), and critical industrial inputs, representing diverse risk profiles and sufficient trade volume for robust time-series analysis across the 2020-2025 period. The selection ensures representation across HS chapters while maintaining analytical depth necessary for detailed NTM mapping and retrospective case study validation. Total bilateral trade covered: approximately $44 billion per quarter, or ~15% of total US-China bilateral trade.
